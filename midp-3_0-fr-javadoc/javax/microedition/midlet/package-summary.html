Package javax.microedition.midlet Description
</H2>

<P>
<p>
    The MIDlet package defines Mobile Information Device Profile (MIDP)
    applications and the interactions between the application and the
    environment in which the application runs. An application of the Mobile
    Information Device Profile is a <code>MIDlet</code>.
</p>

<p>
    Unless otherwise noted, passing a <code>null</code> argument to a
    constructor or method in any class or interface in this package
    MUST cause a <code>java.lang.NullPointerException</code> to be thrown.
</p>


<h2 class="section">MIDlets</h2>
    <p>
        The MIDP defines an application model to allow the limited
        resources of the device to be shared by multiple MIDP applications, or
        MIDlets. It defines what a MIDlet is, how it is packaged, what execution
        environment is available to the MIDlet, and how it should behave so
        that the device can manage its resources. The application model defines
        how multiple MIDlets forming a suite can be packaged together.
    </p>

    <p>
        A MIDlet is the entity that is launched by the
        Application Management Software (AMS). Each MIDlet consists of a class
        that extends the <code>javax.microedition.midlet.MIDlet</code>
        class and other classes as may be needed by the MIDlet.
        When a MIDlet is invoked, a Java
        Virtual Machine is needed on which the classes can be executed. A new
        instance of the MIDlet is created by the application management
        software and used to inform the MIDlet that it has been started or
        destroyed.
    </p>

    <p>
        A MIDlet suite is a collection of MIDlets packaged in a JAR as
        described in <a href="packaging.html#midlet_suite_packaging">MIDlet Suite Packaging</a>.
        The manifest in the JAR contains attributes that are used during installation and
        execution of MIDlets.
    </p>

    <p>
        Each MIDlet is executed in a separate execution environment that
        MUST not share any VM resources with any other MIDlet.
        All of the MIDlets in a MIDlet suite are subject
        to a single set of policies and controls.
        Refer to <a href="concurrency.html#MIDP 3.0 MIDlet Concurrency">MIDP 3.0 MIDlet Concurrency</a> for more
        requirements.
    </p>

    <p>
        A MIDP application MUST use only functionality specified by
        the MIDP specification, the requested configuration, optional packages,
        and <a href="overview.html#LOC">Licensee Open Classes</a> as it
        is developed, tested, deployed, and run.
    </p>

    <p>
        Sharing of data and other information between MIDlets is
        controlled by the individual APIs and their implementations. For
        example, the <a href="javadoc/javax/microedition/rms/package-summary.html">Record
        Management System API</a> specifies the methods that
        are used when the record stores associated with a MIDlet suite are
        shared among MIDlets.
    </p>



<h2 class="section">MIDlet Suite Security</h2>
    <p>
        The MIDP 1.0 specification constrained each MIDlet suite to
        operate in a sandbox wherein all of the APIs available to the MIDlets
        would prevent access to sensitive functions of the device. That sandbox
        concept is used in this specification and all untrusted MIDlet suites
        are subject to its limitations. Every implementation of this
        specification MUST support running untrusted MIDlet suites.
    </p>

    <p>
        MIDP 2.0 introduced the concept of trusted applications that
        may be permitted to use APIs that are considered sensitive and are
        restricted. If and when a device determines that a MIDlet suite can be
        trusted the device allows access as indicated by the policy.
        <a href="security_framework.html#security_framework">Security for MIDP Applications</a>
        section describes the concepts and capabilities
        of untrusted and trusted applications.
    </p>

    <p>
        One aspect of the MIDlet security model is that each MIDlet suite runs
        in isolation, and cannot gain access to the variables, data, memory,
        etc. of a MIDlet in a different MIDlet. This is important because the
        integrity and privacy of the MIDlet data must be maintained and protected
        from rogue MIDlets either attempting to ascertain secret information or
        being destructive. With the LIBlet development model, where the LIBlet
        code may be developed and deployed independently (any by independent
        entities) from the MIDlet code, yet where the two are bound together to
        run in one execution environment, the security risks are significant.
        A LIBlet can gain access to MIDlet private data, can modify this data freely,
        and can even inherit the security privileges granted to the MIDlet.
    </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                By itself, a LIBlet, unlike a MIDlet, is not associated with a domain.
            </li>
            <li>
                Permissions while executing LIBlet code are the permissions associated
                with the MIDlet's execution environment.
            </li>
            <li>
                Trust level (determining if the LIBlet has been tampered with) is handled
                by placing the LIBlet JAR hash in the dependent MIDlets JAD.
            </li>
        </ul>

<a name="execution"/>
<h2 class="section">MIDP Execution Environment</h2>
    <p>
        The MIDP defines the execution environment provided to MIDlets.
        Each MIDlet executed receives its own execution environment.
        The loading of classes, class state, static variable data, and static
        initializers is managed per execution environment.
        The application management software initiates the applications
        and makes the following available to the MIDlet:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            Classes and native code that implement the supporting Java
            ME Configuration (CLDC or CDC), including a Java Virtual Machine
        </li>

        <li>
            Classes and native code that implement the MIDP specification
        </li>

        <li>
            Classes from the MIDlet suite JAR for execution
        </li>

        <li>
            Classes from each LIBlet required by the MIDlet suite
        </li>

        <li>
            Files from the MIDlet suite JAR as resources;
            class files SHOULD be available
        </li>

        <li>
            Files from each LIBlet required by the MIDlet suite as resources;
            class files SHOULD be available
        </li>

        <li>
            Contents of the application descriptor, when it is present
        </li>

        <li>
            Any other APIs available on the device such as
            implementations of additional Optional Packages,
            <a href="overview.html#LOC">Licensee Open Classes</a>, etc.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        The CDC or CLDC and Java Virtual Machine provides multi-threading,
        locking and synchronization, the execution of byte codes, dispatching
        of methods, etc. A single VM is the scope of all policy, naming, and
        resource management. If a device supports multiple VMs, each may have
        its own scope, naming, and resource management policies. MIDlet suites
        MUST NOT contain classes that are in packages defined by the CDC, CLDC,
        MIDP, or optional packages.
    </p>

    <p>
        The behavior of MIDlets in MIDP 3.0 is defined for two different Java ME
        configurations: CLDC 1.1.1 and CDC.
        Access to the functionality defined by configurations is controlled by the JAD
        attribute <code>MicroEdition-Configuration</code>. A MIDlet may choose
        the appropriate execution environment using the following attribute
        value definitions:
    </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                    If the value of the <code>MicroEdition-Configuration</code>
                    attribute in the JAD file of the MIDlet suite is "<code>CLDC-1.1.1</code>",
                    then execution environment MUST conform to the
                    CLDC Specification, version 1.1.1 or higher and
                    the MIDlet SHALL have access to all of its functionality
                    (within the restrictions imposed by the security policy).
                </p>
                <p>
                    All systems compliant with the MIDP3 Specification MUST provide support
                    for the "<code>CLDC-1.1.1</code>" value of the <code>MicroEdition-Configuration</code>
                    attribute, and the behavior associated with this attribute value.
                </p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p>
                    If the value of the <code>MicroEdition-Configuration</code>
                    attribute in the JAD file of the MIDlet suite is "<code>CDC-1.1</code>",
                    then execution environment MUST conform to the
                    CDC Specification, version requested or higher and
                    the MIDlet SHALL have access to all of its functionality
                    (within the restrictions imposed by the security policy).
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the CDC environment, the sandbox security requirements defined in
                    the CLDC Specification are superseded by the more fine-grained
                    security model offered by the CDC Specification. Access to
                    CDC-specific functionality is controlled by the
                    security policy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Support for the "<code>CDC-1.1</code>" values of the
                    <code>MicroEdition-Configuration</code> attribute and the associated behavior
                    is OPTIONAL.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>

    <p>
        If the system cannot honor a MIDlet's request for a particular
        execution environment, then the installation of the MIDlet MUST fail.
        <a href="provisioning.html#StatusCodes">Status Code 908</a> (Incompatible Configuration or Profile)
        MUST be used when reporting the installation failure.
    </p>

    <p>
        The MIDP implementation provides the classes that implement the MIDP APIs.
        The implementation MUST ensure that the application programmer cannot
        override, modify, or add any classes to these system packages.
    </p>

    <p>
        A single JAR file contains all the classes of the MIDlet. The
        MIDlet may load and invoke methods from :
        <ul>
            <li>any class in the MIDlet JAR,</li>
            <li>any class in each LIBlet the MIDlet specified a dependency on,</li>
            <li>any class in the MIDP,</li>
            <li>any class in the supporting Java ME Configuration (CLDC or CDC), and</li>
            <li>any class in optional packages.</li>
        </ul>
        All of the classes, class state, static variable data, and static initializers
        within these scopes are unique to the execution environment provided
        by the AMS for the MIDlet. All states accessible via
        those classes are available to any Java class running on behalf of the
        MIDlet.
    </p>

    <p>
        When a MIDlet that depends on one or more LIBlets is launched, all the
        code of the MIDlet and LIBlets is executed in an execution environment,
        indistinguishable from a standalone MIDlet packaging all the MIDlet and
        LIBlet code in a single MIDlet JAR. That is, the MIDlet and LIBlets
        it depends on are executed on the same Java heap, in the same Protection
        Domain, and with the same security policy/manager.
    </p>

    <p>
        The act of loading a MIDlet with all the associated LIBlets it declares
        dependencies on directly or indirectly into a single execution environment is
        called binding. Once bound, the LIBlet code is executed within the MIDlet
        execution environment as if it were packaged into the MIDlet JAR. Thus,
        although a LIBlet bound to different MIDlets may access shared persistent
        resources through RMS or other persistent storage, the execution of its
        code inside different bindings will be completely isolated from each other.
    </p>


    <p>
        The class files of the MIDlet or dependent LIBlets
        MUST be available for execution and SHOULD be available as resources.
        The implementation MAY store and
        interpret the contents of the JAR in any manner suitable.
    </p>

    <p>
        The files from the JAR that are not Java class files are
        made available via <code>java.lang.Class.getResourceAsStream</code>;
        for example, the contents of the manifest file are made available in
        this manner.
    </p>

    <p>
        The contents of the MIDlet descriptor file, when it is
        present, are made available via the
        <code>javax.microedition.midlet.MIDlet.getAppProperty(String key)</code>
        method.
        This method can not be used to retrieve contents of the LIBlet descriptor file.
        The <code>javax.microedition.midlet.MIDlet.getAppProperty(String name,
        String vendor, String attributeName, String attributeDelimiter) </code>
        method is used to retrieve and at the same time parse application property
        values from the application descriptor and the manifest of the MIDlet or bound
        LIBlets. This method retrieves a property value for a specific LIBlet or
        MIDlet, so the same property name is allowed to be used by multiple LIBlets
        without ambiguity in the binding.
    </p>

<h2 class="section">Screen Size Requirements</h2>
    <p>
        An application MAY define the minimum and/or maximum screen
        sizes that it is designed to work with using the
        <code>MIDlet-Minimum-Canvas-Size</code> and/or
        <code>MIDlet-Maximum-Canvas-Size</code> attributes.
        If either of the <code>MIDlet-Minimum-Canvas-Size</code>
        or <code>MIDlet-Maximum-Canvas-Size</code> attributes are specified,
        and the primary display of the device is incapable of meeting the specified
        size requirements, then the MIDlet suite installation MUST fail
        (see <a href="provisioning.html#display_size_failure">Installation</a> for more details).
    </p>

    <p>
        On devices that support multiple orientations, the MIDlet suite MAY be
        installed if the application's size requirements can be met using one
        or more of its available orientations. Implementations SHOULD select
        a display and orientation that meets the application's display requirements.
    </p>

<h2 class="section">Screen Saver MIDlets</h2>
    <p>
        A screen saver MIDlet is an application that can be launched automatically when
        the device has been in the idle state for a predetermined amount of time.
        The idle state is typically a state in which the device is not actively being used;
        for example, if there is no call ongoing and the user has not pressed any
        keys. The precise definition of the idle state depends on the device implementation.
        The screen saver keeps running until it is deactivated by an external event,
        such as a user action or by a platform dependent timeout.
    </p>

<h3 class="section">Screen Saver Identification</h3>
    <p>
        Screen saver MIDlets are identified with the Application Attribute
        <a href="packaging.html#MIDlet-N-Type">
        <code>MIDlet-&lt;n&gt;-Type</code></a>.  The type
        for identifying a screen saver MIDlet is <code>screensaver</code>.
        In order to indicate a screen saver MIDlet in the MIDlet suite, either
        the JAD file or the JAR manifest MUST have a <a href="packaging.html#MIDlet-N-Type">
        <code>MIDlet-&lt;n&gt;-Type</code></a><code>: screensaver</code>
        entry.
    </p>

    <p>
        For example :

<h3 class="section">Screen Saver Provisioning</h3>
    <p>
        MIDlet suites that contain a screen saver MIDlet are provisioned
        in the same way as all other MIDlet suites. The following additional
        requirements apply :
        <ul>
            <li>
                If a MIDlet suite that is being updated contains a screen saver
                MIDlet that has been previously selected as the current screen saver,
                the user SHOULD be notified that the currently selected screen
                saver MIDlet is being updated, and the updated screen saver MIDlet
                MUST be set as the currently selected screen saver.
                If the new MIDlet suite does not contain a screen saver
                MIDlet with the same name as the previously selected screen
                saver MIDlet, the user SHOULD be notified that the currently
                selected screen saver is no longer available.
            </li>
            <li>
                If a MIDlet suite that is being deleted contains a screen saver
                MIDlet that has been previously selected as the current screen saver,
                the user SHOULD be notified that the current screen saver MIDlet is being
                deleted.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>

<h3 class="section">Screen Saver MIDlet Execution</h3>
    <p>
        In order to receive events corresponding to activation and deactivation
        of the screen saver, a MIDlet must register a
        <A HREF="../../../javax/microedition/event/EventDataListener.html" title="interface in javax.microedition.event"><CODE>EventDataListener</CODE></A> with
        <A HREF="../../../javax/microedition/event/EventManager.html#addEventListener(java.lang.String, javax.microedition.event.EventDataListener, boolean)"><CODE>EventManager.addEventListener</CODE></A>. A screen saver MIDlet should register such a listener
        immediately after it has been started, as soon as it is ready to act as a screen saver.
        The event that corresponds to changes in screen saver state is
        <A HREF="../../../javax/microedition/event/EventData.html#SCREENSAVER_MODE"><CODE>SCREENSAVER_MODE</CODE></A>.
        When a screen saver is activated or deactivated, the
        <A HREF="../../../javax/microedition/event/EventData.html#SCREENSAVER_MODE"><CODE>SCREENSAVER_MODE</CODE></A>
        event MUST be sent to all registered screen saver applications.
        A MIDlet can then determine if it is the currently selected screen saver by querying
        <A HREF="../../../javax/microedition/midlet/MIDlet.html#isSelectedScreenSaver()"><CODE>MIDlet.isSelectedScreenSaver</CODE></A>.
        A MIDlet can also query the state of the
        <A HREF="../../../javax/microedition/event/EventData.html#SCREENSAVER_MODE"><CODE>SCREENSAVER_MODE</CODE></A> event
        with the
        <A HREF="../../../javax/microedition/event/EventManager.html#getCurrent(java.lang.String)"><CODE>EventManager.getCurrent(event)</CODE></A>
        method. If the currently selected screen saver MIDlet is not running when the screen saver
        is activated, the AMS MUST start the currently selected screen saver MIDlet.
    </p>

        <p>
        When a screen saver MIDlet is not running as the active screen saver, it
        runs like any other MIDlet. This provides the opportunity to allow
        configuration and preview of the screen saver. A screen saver MIDlet
        may  also add content to the idle screen with
        <A HREF="../../../javax/microedition/lcdui/IdleItem.html" title="class in javax.microedition.lcdui"><CODE>IdleItem</CODE></A>.
        In this case it MUST  also announce itself as an active idle MIDlet through the
        <a href="packaging.html#MIDlet-N-Type"><code>MIDlet-&lt;n&gt;-Type</code></a>
        attribute with value <code>idlescreen</code>. More information on the idle screen can be
        found <code>javax.microedition.lcdui</code> package.
        </p>

<h3 class="section">Screen Saver Deactivation</h3>
    <p>
        Once in the active mode, a screen saver MIDlet MAY be deactivated by a key
        event. A device MAY have one or more keys that do not cause
        the screen saver MIDlet to be terminated in the active mode. These keys
        can be, for example, used to turn on a dimmed screen backlight. When the
        screen saver MIDlet is deactivated, the <code>SCREENSAVER_MODE</code> event
        with value <code>SCREENSAVER_MODE_DEACTIVATED</code> is sent to all registered applications.
    </p>

    <p>
        If the screen saver MIDlet uses functionality that is protected with the
        security policy, the security prompts shown to the user when screen saver
        is activated are problematic. The security prompts SHOULD NOT deactivate the
        screen saver. However this functionality may be impossible or at best
        difficult to implement. Therefore sequence of events that the
        screen saver MIDlet MAY expect are as follows :
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            When the screen saver MIDlet is activated, it receives
            <code>SCREENSAVER_MODE</code> event with value <code>SCREENSAVER_MODE_ACTIVATED</code>.
        </li>
        <li>
            The MIDlet's <code>Display</code> capabilities are changed to indicate no further
            user input events will be delivered to the screen saver MIDlet.
        </li>
        <li>
            When the screen saver MIDlet uses functionality that triggers a security
            dialog or user input widget, the <code>Display</code> capabilities are
            changed to deliver user input and a <code>SCREENSAVER_MODE</code> event
            with value <code>SCREENSAVER_MODE_DEACTIVATED</code> is sent to the screen saver MIDlet.
        </li>
        <li>
            After the user input is completed, the AMS SHOULD activate
            the screen saver again and a <code>SCREENSAVER_MODE</code> event with
            value <code>SCREENSAVER_MODE_ACTIVATED</code> is sent to the screen saver MIDlet. The
            MIDlet's <code>Display</code> capabilities are changed as appropriate.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        An implementation MAY also use system screens to temporarily obscure a screen
        saver display.
    </p>

    <p>
        The screen saver MIDlet MAY also be deactivated by implementation specific
        actions or timeouts; these may include :
    </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Incoming call or message</li>
            <li>Launching of a MIDlet through PushRegistry</li>
            <li>Uncaught exception in the screen saver MIDlet</li>
            <li>Entering the power save mode of the device</li>
            <li>Activation of device key guard functionality</li>
            <li>MIDlet terminating itself with the <code>MIDlet.notifyDestroyed()</code>
               method</li>
        </ul>

<h3 class="section">Screen Saver Security</h3>
    <p>
        From the security point of view, a screen saver MIDlet is
        handled as any other MIDlet. As such, if the screen saver MIDlet
        satisfies security requirements for specific APIs, those APIs MUST be
        accessible to the MIDlet.
    </p>


<a name="IdleScreenMIDlets"/>
<h2 class="section">Idle Screen MIDlets</h2>
    <p>
        Most mobile platforms feature some concept of an idle screen - a default
        display which is presented to the user when no other activity is taking place
        on the device. Typically the idle screen is not empty but features UI
        components which provide status information about the device (signal strength,
        battery levels), information about services on the device (number of unread
        emails, calendar event information, headlines from a news feed) and shortcuts
        or controls for popular applications (music players controls).
        MIDlets can offer the same capability by setting
        the <A HREF="../../../javax/microedition/lcdui/IdleItem.html" title="class in javax.microedition.lcdui"><CODE>IdleItem</CODE></A> for a Display.
        <a href="#figure15-2">Figure 15-2 below</a> shows how idle screen
        MIDlets can be placed into a device's idle screen.

        </tr>
    </table>

    <p>
        A MIDlet that wants to add content to the idle screen is identified with
        an application attribute
        <a href="packaging.html#MIDlet-N-Type">
            <code>MIDlet-&lt;n&gt;-Type</code></a> with the value <code>idlescreen</code></a>.
        For example:
    </p>

    <table border="1" bgcolor="silver">
        <tr>
            <td>
                <pre>
    MIDlet-1: NewsTicker, /icon.png, NewsTickerMIDlet
    MIDlet-1-Type: idlescreen
                </pre>
            </td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <p>
        More than one MIDlet on the device can add content to the idle screen.
    </p>


<h2 class="section">Auto Start MIDlets</h2>
    <p>
        MIDlets that are auto-started by the device on power-up and restarted
        (on exit of the MIDlet) are called "Auto Start MIDlets". The AMS MUST
        attempt to start the MIDlet on power-up; however, the system MAY fail
        start such MIDlets due to resource constraints at power-up. In
        addition, the AMS MUST attempt to restart Auto Start MIDlets on
        exit/termination of the MIDlet; however, the system may fail to restart
        the MIDlet due to resource limitations or other system failures. In
        both these failure cases, the AMS MUST make at least one attempt to
        restart the MIDlet.
    </p>
    <p>
        A MIDlet developer marks a MIDlet as Auto Start using the
        <a href="packaging.html#MIDlet-N-Type">
        <code>MIDlet-&lt;n&gt;-Type</code></a> attribute.
        If the attribute value includes <code>autostart</code>,
        the MIDlet assumes the Auto Start MIDlet behavior. The MIDlet suite
        must have the <code>javax.microedition.midlet.AutoStartPermission</code> for a
        MIDlet to assume this behavior.
    </p>

<h2 class="section">Controlling User actions on a MIDlet Suite</h2>
    <p>
        A MIDlet developer may want to restrict the actions allowed on a
        MIDlet by the user. User actions on a MIDlet are controlled using
        the <a href="packaging.html#MIDlet-N-UserDenied"><code>MIDlet-</code><i>&lt;n&gt;</i><code>-UserDenied</code>
        attribute</a>.
        Actions include the ability for a user to launch a MIDlet and the ability
        to stop a running MIDlet from an AMS screen.
        User actions on a MIDlet Suite are controlled using the
        <a href="packaging.html#MIDlet-UserDenied"><code>MIDlet-UserDenied</code></a>
        attribute. User actions on a Suite include the ability to update or delete
        a MIDlet suite.
    </p>
    <p>
        MIDlet Suites that declare attributes to control user action require
        the <A HREF="../../../javax/microedition/midlet/ActionsDeniedPermission.html" title="class in javax.microedition.midlet"><CODE>ActionsDeniedPermission</CODE></A>
        Permission. If any of the user actions attributes are present and this Permission is
        not granted, the installation of the MIDlet Suite MUST fail.
    </p>
    <p>
        If the <a href="packaging.html#MIDlet-N-UserDenied"><code>MIDlet-</code><i>&lt;n&gt;</i><code>-UserDenied</code></a>
        attribute is not present in the JAD/Manifest, no user actions are denied on this MIDlet. If the
        <a href="packaging.html#MIDlet-UserDenied"><code>MIDlet-UserDenied</code></a>
        attribute is not present in the JAD/Manifest, none of allowed user actions
        are denied on the MIDlet Suite.
    </p>

<a name="persistent_midlet_suites"/>
<h3 class="section">Persistent MIDlet Suites</h3>
    <p>
        A MIDlet Suite that cannot be deleted by the user is a Persistent MIDlet
        Suite. A MIDlet developer marks a suite as Persistent using the
        <a href="packaging.html#MIDlet-UserDenied">
        <code>MIDlet-UserDenied</code></a> attribute. If the attribute value
        includes <code>delete</code>, the suite is a Persistent MIDlet Suite as the user is denied the ability
        to delete the MIDlet Suite. When a Persistent MIDlet suite is being installed,
        the user MUST be prompted to confirm that the MIDlet Suite installation can proceed, and that
        the user will not be able to delete the MIDlet suite after installation.
    </p>

<a name="version_numbering"/>
<h2 class="section">Version Numbering</h2>
    <p>
        Version numbers have the format Major.Minor[.Micro]
        (X.X[.X]), where the .Micro portion MAY be omitted. (If the .Micro
        portion is omitted, then it defaults to zero). In addition, each
        portion of the version number is allowed a maximum of two decimal
        digits (i.e., 0-99). Version numbers are described in
        <a href="overview.html#JPVS">[JPVS]</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
        For example, 1.0.0 can be used to specify the first version
        of a MIDlet suite. For each portion of the version number, leading
        zeros are not significant. For example, 08 is equivalent to 8. Also,
        1.0 is equivalent to 1.0.0. However, 1.1 is equivalent to 1.1.0, and
        not 1.0.1.
    </p>

    <p>
        A missing MIDlet-Version tag is assumed to be 0.0.0, which
        means that any non-zero version number is considered as a newer version
        of the MIDlet suite.
    </p>


<h2 class="section">MIDlet Classes</h2>
    <p>
        All Java classes needed by the MIDlet are be placed in the
        JAR using the standard structure, based on mapping the fully
        qualified class names to directory and file names. Each period is
        converted to a forward slash ( / ) and the <code>.class</code>
        extension is appended. For example, a class <code>com.sun.microedition.Test</code>
        would be placed in the JAR with the name <code>com/sun/microedition/Test.class</code>.
    </p>


<a name="lifecycle"/>
<h2 class="section">Application Lifecycle</h2>
    <p>
        Each MIDlet MUST extend the <code>MIDlet</code>
        class. The <code>MIDlet</code> class allows for the
        orderly starting, stopping, and cleanup of the MIDlet. The MIDlet can
        request the arguments from the application descriptor to communicate
        with the application management software.
        If a MIDlet class identified by
        <a href="packaging.html#MIDlet-N"><code>MIDlet-&lt;n&gt;</code></a> has a
        <code>public static void main(String[])</code> method, it MUST be ignored by
        the application management software. Unlike other Java application environments,
        MIDP does not use the <code>public static void main(String[])</code> method
        as the entry point of the application. Instead, the methods of the initial
        MIDlet class are called as defined by the MIDlet lifecycle model.
    </p>

    <p>
        When a MIDlet suite is installed on a device, its classes,
        resource files, arguments, and persistent storage are kept on the
        device and ready for use. The MIDlet(s) are available to the user via
        the device's application management software.
    </p>

    <p>
        When the MIDlet is run, an instance of the MIDlet's primary
        class is created using its public no-argument constructor, and the
        methods of the <code>MIDlet</code> are called to sequence
        the MIDlet through its various states. The MIDlet can either request
        changes in state or notify the application management software of state
        changes via the <code>MIDlet</code> methods. When the
        MIDlet is finished or terminated by the application management
        software, it is destroyed, and the resources it used can be reclaimed,
        including any objects it created and its classes. The MIDlet MUST NOT
        call <code>System.exit</code> , which will throw a <code>SecurityException</code>
        when called by a MIDlet.
    </p>

    <p>
        The normal states of Java classes are not affected by these
        classes as they are loaded. Referring to any class will cause it to be
        loaded, and the normal static initialization will occur.
    </p>

<h2 class="section">MIDlet Lifecycle</h2>
    <p>
        The <code>MIDlet</code> lifecycle defines the protocol between a
        <code>MIDlet</code> and its environment through the following:
    </p>
        <ul>
            <li>A simple well-defined state machine</li>
            <li>A concise definition of the MIDlet's states</li>
            <li>APIs to signal changes between the states</li>
        </ul>

<h3 class="section">MIDlet Lifecycle Definitions</h3>
    <p>
        The following definitions are used in the <code>MIDlet</code>
        lifecycle:
    </p>
        <a name="appMgrDefined"/>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <code><b>application management software</b></code> - a part of the
                device's software operating environment that manages
                <code>MIDlets</code>. It maintains the <code>MIDlet</code> state and directs
                the <code>MIDlet</code> through state changes.
            </li>

            <li>
                <code><b>MIDlet</b></code> - a MIDP application on the device.
                The <code>MIDlet</code> can signal the application management
                software about whether is it wants to run or has completed. A
                <code>MIDlet</code> has no knowledge of other <code>MIDlet</code>s
                through the <code>MIDlet</code> API.
            </li>

            <li>
                <b><code>MIDlet</code> States</b> - the states a <code>MIDlet</code>
                can have are defined by the transitions allowable through the
                <code>MIDlet</code> interface. More specific application states
                are known only to the application.
            </li>
        </ul>

<h2 class="section">MIDlet States</h2>
    <p>
        The <code>MIDlet</code> state machine is designed to ensure that the
        behavior of an application is consistent and as close as possible to
        what device manufactures and users expect; specifically :
    </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                The perceived startup latency of an application SHOULD be
                very short.
            </li>
            <li>
                It SHOULD be possible to destroy an application at any
                time.
            </li>
        </ul>
    <p>
        The <em>Paused</em> state described below is included for backward
        compatibility with previous versions. For MIDP 3.0 MIDlet suites, the

        The application SHOULD take measures to avoid race

        method may need to synchronize itself with the other methods avoid
        concurrency problems during state changes.

<h2 class="section">Example MIDlet Application</h2>

        measurement of the speed of the Java Virtual Machine.

<a name=splashscreens""/>
<h2 class="section">Splash Screens</h2>
           <p>
           An application may specify a splash screen in its manifest (see
           <a href="packaging.html">Packaging</a> section for more details).
           </p>

           <p>
           The splash screen is shown only when the application
           is started by the user. The splash screen is shown on the
           primary Display.
           </p>

           <p>
           The implementation should show the splash screen as soon as possible
           after the MIDlet is launched, but it must guarantee that it is visible to
           the user by the time the MIDlet's startApp method is called.
           </p>

           <p>
           Once shown, the splash screen will remain visible until one of the
           following events occurs:
           </p>
           <ul>
           <li>The MIDlet shows a Displayable by calling setCurrent on its primary
           Display</li>
           <li>The MIDlet's startApp method returns</li>
           <li>The MIDlet is no longer in the foreground</li>
