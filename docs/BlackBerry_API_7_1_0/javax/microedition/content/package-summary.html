Package javax.microedition.content Description
</H2>

<P>
<P>The Content Handler API and execution model allow an application to
  invoke registered J2ME and non-Java applications by URL, by content
  type, or by content handler ID.  Content handlers can
  chain to other content handlers to respond to invocations.


<p>The functions of content handler classes are:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><A HREF="../../../javax/microedition/content/Registry.html" title="class in javax.microedition.content"><CODE>Registry</CODE></A> &nbsp; - invokes,
registers, unregisters and queries content handlers</li>
  <li><A HREF="../../../javax/microedition/content/ContentHandler.html" title="interface in javax.microedition.content"><CODE>ContentHandler</CODE></A> &nbsp; -
provides the details of a registration and to handle requests to an
application </li>
  <li><A HREF="../../../javax/microedition/content/Invocation.html" title="class in javax.microedition.content"><CODE>Invocation</CODE></A> &nbsp; - contains
the parameters passed to and returned from a content handler and used
to select a content handler to invoke</li>
  <li> <A HREF="../../../javax/microedition/content/ContentHandlerServer.html" title="interface in javax.microedition.content"><CODE>ContentHandlerServer</CODE></A> &nbsp; -
processes requests to handle content</li>
  <li><A HREF="../../../javax/microedition/content/RequestListener.html" title="interface in javax.microedition.content"><CODE>RequestListener</CODE></A> &nbsp; -
notifies the content handler of pending requests</li>
  <li><A HREF="../../../javax/microedition/content/ResponseListener.html" title="interface in javax.microedition.content"><CODE>ResponseListener</CODE></A> &nbsp; -
notifies the application of pending responses</li>
  <li> <A HREF="../../../javax/microedition/content/ActionNameMap.html" title="class in javax.microedition.content"><CODE>ActionNameMap</CODE></A> &nbsp; - maps
actions to action names</li>
  <li><A HREF="../../../javax/microedition/content/ContentHandlerException.html" title="class in javax.microedition.content"><CODE>ContentHandlerException</CODE></A> &nbsp; -
reports content handler errors</li>
  <li><A HREF="../../../javax/microedition/content/ContentHandlerPermission.html" title="class in javax.microedition.content"><CODE>ContentHandlerPermission</CODE></A> &nbsp; -
Content Handler Permission</li>
</ul>
<p>Applications use CHAPI in two ways, as an invoking application or as
a content handler application. The invoking application is primarily
concerned with the functions of the <A HREF="../../../javax/microedition/content/Registry.html" title="class in javax.microedition.content"><CODE>Registry</CODE></A> and <A HREF="../../../javax/microedition/content/Invocation.html" title="class in javax.microedition.content"><CODE>Invocation</CODE></A> classes. As a client,
the application makes requests to display or act on some content. The
application makes a request by supplying parameters that identifies the
content by URL or the content type, or the ID of the content handler,
and possibly an action to perform. If the application needs to know
when a request is complete or to get a result it can require a response
from the content handler. The application creates an <code>Invocation</code>
instance and initializes it with the parameters. The application calls
the <code>Registry.invoke</code> method to start the request. Only if
the invoking application is expecting a result does it need to retrieve
the response using <code>Registry.getResponse</code>. The application
can register a listener with <code>Registry.setListener</code> to be
notified when the response is available. </p>
<p>A more advanced client application may want to use the detailed
information about content handlers stored in <A HREF="../../../javax/microedition/content/ContentHandler.html" title="interface in javax.microedition.content"><CODE>ContentHandler</CODE></A> objects
including the types, suffixes, and actions, or information about the
content handler application including its authorization, application
name and version, and content handler ID. If the application allows the
user to choose the action to be performed, it should use the handler's
<A HREF="../../../javax/microedition/content/ActionNameMap.html" title="class in javax.microedition.content"><CODE>ActionNameMap</CODE></A>s to get locale
appropriate action names.
</p>
<p>As a server, the content handler application responds to invocation
requests from clients. The content handler application uses the methods
of <A HREF="../../../javax/microedition/content/ContentHandlerServer.html" title="interface in javax.microedition.content"><CODE>ContentHandlerServer</CODE></A> and <A HREF="../../../javax/microedition/content/Invocation.html" title="class in javax.microedition.content"><CODE>Invocation</CODE></A>. New requests are retrieved from
the <code>ContentHandlerServer.getRequest</code> method. The content
handler can register a listener with <code>ContentHandlerServer.setListener</code>
to be notified when new requests are available. The content handler
uses the parameters in the <code>Invocation</code> to process the
request. If a URL was supplied, the content can be retrieved with the <code>Invocation.open</code>
method using the Generic Connection Framework. The content handler uses
the URL, type, and action to determine how it should act on the
content. When the content handler is done with each request it returns
updated parameters and arguments and a status with the <code>ContentHandlerServer.finish</code>
method.
</p>
<p>A more advanced content handler application can both be a client and
a server. Methods on the <A HREF="../../../javax/microedition/content/Registry.html" title="class in javax.microedition.content"><CODE>Registry</CODE></A> are used for the advanced functions. New requests can be
chained to previous requests with the <code>invoke</code> method. The
content handler may restrict access and visibility to itself during
registration. An detailed example is provided in Appendix A.
</p>
<h2>Implementation Requirements</h2>
<ul>
  <li> The system property <code>microedition.chapi.version</code> can
be used to determine whether CHAPI is implemented, and if it is, the
version number. If this specification is implemented in a CLDC Java
runtime environment, the property <code>microedition.chapi.version</code>
MUST have the value <tt>"1.0"</tt> or <tt>"1.0.1"</tt> as returned
from the <code>java.lang.System.getProperty</code> method.
For all other Java runtimes, the property value returned must be <tt>"1.0.1"</tt>. </li>
  <li>Support is required for the URL scheme "<code>http</code>",
  the <code>javax.microedition.io.HttpConnection</code>
  interface and corresponding protocol.</li>
  <li>Support is required for invocation using the URL scheme "<code>https</code>",
  if <code>https</code> is supported by the Generic Connection Framework.</li>

  <li>Support is required for invocation using the URL scheme "<code>file</code>",
  if <code>file</code> is supported by the Generic Connection Framework.</li>

  <li>The <A HREF="../../../javax/microedition/content/Invocation.html" title="class in javax.microedition.content"><CODE>Invocation</CODE></A> class and
invocation mechanism MUST support passing and returning the values in an 
Invocation including the URL, Type, Action, ID, Args, Data, and
InvokingAppName, InvokingAuthority, and InvokingID, etc. as
data totaling at least 16384 bytes. Each character of a String is
counted as two bytes. It must be able to pass and return at least 10
arguments in the arguments array. </li>
  <li> Content handler registrations that are successful MUST be
preserved across soft and hard restarts of the device software
including unexpected power interruptions.</li>
  <li> The security policy of the Java runtime environment MUST be used
to enforce limitations on access to content using CHAPI. 
Permissions and access control must be the same as though <code>Connector.open</code>
were used to access the content. </li>
  <li> Support is required for at least 50 types, at least 20 actions per handler,
      at least 10 locales per handler, and at least 10 suffixes per handler.
  </li>
  <li> Support is required for Content Handler IDs of at least 256 characters.
</ul>
<h2><a name="provisioning">Installing Content Handlers</a> </h2>
<p>Content handlers may be installed on the device either before they
are needed or when they are needed. The content handler API can be used
to trigger the installation process to install the content handlers on
the device. For at least one downloadable application package type
supported by the device, the CHAPI implementation MUST provide and
register a content handler to perform the installation. Typically, this
includes <code>application/java-archive</code>.</p>

<p>An application can invoke CHAPI with the URL of an application
package. The appropriate installation process for the device MUST be
used to attempt to install the content handler.

<p>
Preregistered content handlers for installing Java applications, such as MIDlet Suites,
MUST be registered with actions
<A HREF="../../../javax/microedition/content/ContentHandler.html#ACTION_INSTALL"><CODE>"install"</CODE></A>,
<A HREF="../../../javax/microedition/content/ContentHandler.html#ACTION_INSTALL_ONLY"><CODE>"install_only"</CODE></A> and
<A HREF="../../../javax/microedition/content/ContentHandler.html#ACTION_OPEN"><CODE>"open"</CODE></A>
and may have additional actions. This means that it
MUST be possible to invoke the installer with any of the actions above
and with <code>null</code> (without any action).

The behavior of the actions <code>"install"</code>, <code>"open"</code>,
and <code>null</code> are the same as if the user
had initiated the installation and provides the same user experience via interactive 
feedback, prompting, and other conveniences provided to the user such as launching the
application.
<p>
The action <code>"install_only"</code> SHOULD limit interactions with the user to those that are
necessary and essential to the installation of the application. The installation process
should be streamlined and must omit all unnecessary prompts and convenience functions.
Ideally, there would be no interaction required by the user. The essential functions include
the user's ability to monitor progress of the installation and to cancel the installation.
The application MUST be installed and made available but MUST NOT be launched as a result
of the installation. Any static registrations like Push Registry or Content Handler
registrations are however handled as in the normal installation process.

The installation MUST
include all of the required security and user prompts as specified in
the appropriate profile and download specification.
</p>

<p>
If a response has been requested by the calling application by calling
setResponseRequired(true), the caller MUST be notified of success or failure of the
installation using OK, ERROR or CANCELLED responses after the installation attempt has
finished. Regardless of any prompts or other actions by the installer or
other applications the invoking application MUST be able to
get the response and process it though there may be a delay
due to limitations on available resources.
The status of the invocation has the following meanings:</p>
<ul>
<li> <A HREF="../../../javax/microedition/content/Invocation.html#OK"><CODE>OK</CODE></A>:
    Application has been installed successfully; including
    the case where the same version requested was previously
    successfully installed.</li>
<li> <A HREF="../../../javax/microedition/content/Invocation.html#ERROR"><CODE>ERROR</CODE></A>:
    Application was not successfully installed.
    The Invocation.getArgs() method MUST return a single String containing
    the description of the error.
    For MIDP, it MUST be the installation status report error number and
    description (as defined in MIDP Provisioning). </li>
<li> <A HREF="../../../javax/microedition/content/Invocation.html#CANCELLED"><CODE>CANCELLED</CODE></A>:
    The request was cancelled by the user.</li>
</ul>

<p>
    If an application wishes to do a self update, it could invoke an install
    on the URL of the updated application using action <code>"install_only"</code> with
    <code>Invocation.setResponseRequired(true)</code> and then it should exit.
    Since the application to be installed is the invoking application
    itself and response required has been set, the updated application
    will be launched and it will receive a notification after the
    installation regardless of whether the update succeeded or failed, but
    as the invoking application not as the installed application.
    During an update, if the application does not exit voluntarily and the
    installation cannot proceed while the application is running,
    the AMS SHOULD force it to exit before continuing with the installation.
    After installation, the response, if any, MUST be delivered to the
    (version of the) application present after the installation.
</p>

<h2>Interacting with the Application Life Cycle</h2>
<p> Content handlers are applications and are subject to the same
security, integrity, installation, upgrade, and other requirements as
any other application in the applicable Java runtime environment.
Authentication of applications and application classes MUST conform to
the requirements of the applicable Java runtime environment.
</p>
<p> Each Java runtime environment has its own application packaging and
runtime requirements. Each content handler application MUST conform to
these requirements. Each Java runtime specifies how applications are
uniquely identified, for example, by a classname of the application
class.
</p>
<p> Installation and removal of content handlers utilizes the normal
mechanisms of the Java runtime environment. During installation, any
content handlers MUST be registered using the attributes defined below
when they appear in the application packaging.
Typically, they will be present in an
application descriptor or JAR manifest. When a content handler
application is removed, all of the static and dynamic registrations of
the content handler application MUST be released.</p>

<h2>Handling Display Transitions - Foreground and Background</h2>
<p> A goal of the Content Handler API is to promote a smooth or
seamless user experience between the invoking application and content
handler. Typically, if the invoking application has a user interface,
one of its screens will be displayed to the user (that is, it will be
in the foreground). If a user action causes an Invocation then the next
screen the user sees should be the content handler for that invocation.
If a foreground content handler finishes with an invocation that
requires a response to the calling application that had the foreground
immediately before the content handler was invoked, and there are no
other requests buffered or being processed from the same calling
application, then the foreground MUST be returned to the calling
application.
</p>
<p>If there is a conflict between foreground transitions and external
events or explicit user actions, then the external events or user
actions should take precedence.
</p>
<h2>Static Registration of Content Handlers</h2>
<p> Content handler registration can, and generally should, be handled
    during the installation of the application. The following attributes
    can be included in the JAR manifest of the application. Each Java
    runtime environment may define their own application packaging
    extensions. If the attributes are present, they MUST
    be used by the installation process to register the content handlers.
    If the application is being upgraded from a previous version then
    static registrations that are not replaced by new registrations are
    removed. </p>

<p> Each content handler is uniquely identified by an ID. Content
handler and application IDs MUST NOT contain control characters (U+0000
thru U+001F) or spaces (U+00020). The ID for content handlers is
supplied in the <code>MicroEdition-Handler-&lt;n&gt;-ID</code>
attribute. If a content handler ID or application ID is not supplied 
then a default ID MUST be generated by the implementation.
The ID MUST NOT be equal to any other registered
handler ID. Every other ID MUST NOT be a prefix of this ID. The ID MUST
NOT be a prefix of any other registered ID. If the ID conflicts with
another ID the installation MUST fail.
If a content handler ID is longer than the implementation supports
then the installation must fail.
For MIDP, the failure mode is documented in the 
"Content Handlers and the Mobile Information Device Profile" section with 
a "939 Content handler install failed".
</p>
<p> Each static content handler registration contains the following
information. Fields are separated using Unicode comma ("," = U+002C).
Whitespace is deleted from the beginning and end of each value where
whitespace consists of sequences of one or more Unicode horizontal tab
(HT = U+0009) or space (" " = U+0020) characters. Each registration
consists of information from a <code>MicroEdition-Handler-&lt;n&gt;</code>
attribute and optional attributes <code>MicroEdition-Handler-&lt;n&gt;-&lt;locale&gt;</code>,
<code>MicroEdition-Handler-&lt;n&gt;-ID: &lt;ID&gt;</code>, and <code>MicroEdition-Handler-&lt;n&gt;-Access</code>.
All of the attributes for a registration have the same value of <code>&lt;n&gt;</code>.
The numeric value for <code>&lt;n&gt;</code> starts at 1 and MUST use
consecutive ordinal numbers for additional entries. The attributes are:
</p>
<pre>MicroEdition-Handler-&lt;n&gt;: &lt;classname&gt;, &lt;type(s)&gt;, &lt;suffix(es)&gt;, &lt;action(s)&gt;, &lt;locale(s)&gt;
MicroEdition-Handler-&lt;n&gt;-&lt;locale&gt;: &lt;localized action names&gt;
MicroEdition-Handler-&lt;n&gt;-ID: &lt;ID&gt;
MicroEdition-Handler-&lt;n&gt;-Access: &lt;ID(s)&gt;</pre>
where:
<ul>
  <li>
    <p> <code>MicroEdition-Handler-&lt;n&gt;</code> - Attribute for
registrations. Multiple registrations can be provided in an
application package. The numeric value for <code>&lt;n&gt;</code> starts at 1
and MUST use consecutive ordinal numbers for additional entries. The
first missing entry terminates the list. Any additional entries are
ignored. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p> <code>MicroEdition-Handler-&lt;n&gt;-&lt;locale&gt;</code> -
Attribute to define the action names appropriate for the actions of the
n<sup>th</sup> content handler for the indicated locale. The locale
string should be properly formatted as defined in class <A HREF="../../../javax/microedition/content/ContentHandler.html" title="interface in javax.microedition.content"><CODE>ContentHandler</CODE></A>.
If the corresponding <code>MicroEdition-Handler-&lt;n&gt;</code>
attribute references this locale attribute then there MUST be an action
name for each action in the corresponding <code>MicroEdition-Handler-&lt;n&gt;</code>
attribute. If the number of action names does not match the number of
actions, then the installation MUST fail. If there are multiple action
names, separate them with a comma ("," = U+002C). Action names MUST allow
embedded whitespace. Leading and trailing whitespace is deleted
from each action name. If a locale attribute is present but is not
referenced by a <code>MicroEdition-Handler-&lt;n&gt;</code> attribute
then it is not used for the registration. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>MicroEdition-Handler-&lt;n&gt;-ID</code> - Attribute to
declare the unique ID for this content handler. The content handler ID
is set during installation and returned from the method <A HREF="../../../javax/microedition/content/ContentHandler.html#getID()"><CODE>ContentHandler.getID</CODE></A>.
If not provided, a unique value MUST be provided by the implementation.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p> <code>MicroEdition-Handler-&lt;n&gt;-Access</code> - Attribute
to control the access and visibility of the content handler. It
contains a list of the IDs of content handlers or applications that are
allowed access and visibility to the content handler. If omitted, all
applications will be allowed access and visibility to the content
handler. If there are multiple IDs, separate them with a space (" " =
U+0020). IDs MUST NOT contain whitespace. Leading and trailing
whitespace is deleted from each ID. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p> <code>classname</code> - Application that is responsible for
handling the content. Leading and trailing whitespace is deleted. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p> <code>type(s)</code> - Content type(s). If there are multiple
types, separate them with a space (" " = U+0020). Types MUST NOT
contain a space. Leading and trailing whitespace is deleted from each
type. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p> <code>suffix(es)</code> - Zero or more suffix strings. If
there are multiple suffixes, separate them with space (" " = U+0020).
Suffixes MUST NOT contain a space. Leading and trailing whitespace is
deleted from each suffix. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p> <code>action(s)</code> - Zero or more actions. If there are
multiple actions, separate them with a space (" " = U+0020). Actions
MUST NOT contain a space. Leading and trailing whitespace is deleted
from each action. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p> <code>locale(s)</code> - Zero or more locales. If there are
multiple locales, separate them with a space (" " = U+0020). Locales
MUST NOT contain a space. Leading and trailing whitespace is deleted
from each locale string. Each locale string is used to identify the <code>MicroEdition-Handler-&lt;n&gt;-&lt;locale&gt;</code>
attribute that contains the action names. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p> <code>ID</code> - Content handler or application ID. Leading
and trailing whitespace is deleted. </p>
  </li>

The values of the attributes are parsed according to the BNF below.
Whitespace (WSP) may be present around delimiters and is deleted from
the beginning and end of each value.
<blockquote>
  <pre><code>
; Syntax of the MicroEdition-Handler-&lt;n&gt; attribute
handler-value = classname ["," types [ "," suffixes ["," actions ["," locales]]]]
&nbsp;
classname =  value-chars
&nbsp;
types =  *type / type WSP types
type = value-chars
&nbsp;
suffixes = *suffix / suffix WSP suffixes
suffix = value-chars
&nbsp;
actions =  *action / action WSP actions
action = value-chars
&nbsp;
locales =  *locale / locale WSP locales
locale = value-chars
&nbsp;
value-chars = 1*(&lt;any Unicode character except CTLs or WSP or COMMA&gt;)
&nbsp;
; Syntax of the MicroEdition-Handler-&lt;n&gt;-locale attribute
action-names =  action-name / (action-name "," action-names)
action-name = value-chars / (value-chars WSP action-name)
&nbsp;
; Syntax of the MicroEdition-Handler-&lt;n&gt;-ID attribute
id-value =  1*(value-chars / COMMA)
&nbsp;
; Syntax of the MicroEdition-Handler-&lt;n&gt;-Access attribute
access-values = id-value / (id-value WSP access-values)
&nbsp;
; Delimiters
HT = %x09        ; Horizontal tab
SP = %x20        ; Space
COMMA = %x2C     ; Comma
WSP = *(SP / HT) ; Whitespace
CTLs = *(%x00 - %x1F)
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<h3>Using the parsed values to register</h3>
<p> The values parsed from the attributes are used to register the
content handler. If there are multiple types, suffixes, actions, or
locales, the order is significant; the values must appear in the same
order when passed to the <tt>Registry.register</tt> method. Each
locale string and the sequence of actions and action names in each <code>MicroEdition-Handler-&lt;n&gt;-&lt;locale&gt;</code>
attribute are used to make a new <A HREF="../../../javax/microedition/content/ActionNameMap.html" title="class in javax.microedition.content"><CODE>ActionNameMap</CODE></A>. The arrays of
types, suffixes, actions, action name maps, ID, and access controls are
used to <A HREF="../../../javax/microedition/content/Registry.html#register(java.lang.String, java.lang.String[], java.lang.String[], java.lang.String[], javax.microedition.content.ActionNameMap[], java.lang.String, java.lang.String[])"><CODE>register</CODE></A>
the classname as a content handler.
</p>
<h3>Access Restrictions and Application IDs</h3>
<p>Content Handlers can control whether they are visible to and can be
invoked by other applications and content handlers. The ID of the
invoking application is matched against the list of IDs that are
allowed access to the handler.
</p>
<p>Note that the invoking application or content handler provides its
own ID. The veracity of the ID can be cross checked with the authority
information that provided for content handlers and invoking
applications. If there is no authority information then the ID cannot
be trusted.
</p>
<p>Each Java runtime environment MUST provide a mechanism to associate
an ID with each application. If an ID is not provided, then a default
value must be provided.</p>

<!-------------------------------------------------------->

<h2>Content Handlers and the Mobile Information Device Profile </h2>
<p> For the MIDP Profile, the implementation MUST support download and
installation of MIDlet suites that include content handlers. The
implementation MUST provide and register content handler(s) to perform
the installation for the type <code>text/vnd.sun.j2me.app-descriptor</code>
and the type <code>application/java-archive</code> for
JAR-only installation.
Preregistered content handlers for installing Java applications,
MUST be registered to handle file suffixes ".jad" and ".jar".

</p>

<p>For the MIDP Profile, a content handler MUST be packaged as a
    MIDlet suite and each content handler MUST implement the MIDlet life
    cycle. It is NOT necessary for the content handler to be registered as
    a user visible MIDlet with a <code>MIDlet-&lt;n&gt;</code> attribute.
    If the content handler MIDlet should be selectable by the user then the
    <code>MIDlet-&lt;n&gt;</code> attribute must be supplied.
    Note: the MIDP specification requires that there be at least the
    <code>MIDlet-&lt;1&gt;</code> attribute regardless of the number
    of content handlers.
</p>

<p>During the installation of a MIDlet suite, each content handler MUST
be registered using the attributes defined in the Java Application
Descriptor and/or in the Manifest. 
See the <a href="#jad">Example of MIDlet Suite Java
Application Descriptor</a> section.
For untrusted applications,
attributes in the JAD override corresponding attributes in the
Manifest. For trusted applications, according to the MIDP
specification, if attributes appear in both the JAD and manifest then
the corresponding attribute values MUST be equal.</p>
<p>Content handlers MUST be installable using the MIDP OTA installation
mechanism. Any failure related to content handler registration
attributes or incorrect or invalid information related to the MIDlet
suite must cause the installation to fail. If the <code>MIDlet-Install-Notify</code>
attribute defined by MIDP OTA is present, then an installation status
report MUST be sent. The installation notifications are: </p>
<ul>
  <li><code>938 Content handler conflicts with other handlers</code><br>
This CHAPI specific notification is sent if there is a conflict between
the ID of any handler in the MIDlet suite being installed and handlers
of existing MIDlet suites so the required content handler registrations
cannot be performed, then the installation MUST fail. </li>
  <li><code>939 Content handler install failed</code> <br>
This CHAPI specific notification is sent if any of the content handler
specific attributes are missing or cannot be parsed correctly or have
values that are not valid to register the content handler then the
installation must fail. This includes at least the values for types,
suffixes, IDs, and actions.
This installation status report is used if
the minimum content handler ID length,
the minimum number of types,
minimum number of actions per handler, minimum number of locales per handler,
or minimum number of suffixes per handler is exceeded and
the implementation does not support larger values.
</li>
  <li><code>910 Application authorization failure</code><br>
This MIDP OTA defined notification is sent if there are static
registration attributes present but the permission <code>javax.microedition.content.ContentHandler</code>
is not requested or not granted. </li>
  <li><code>905 Attribute Mismatch</code><br>
This MIDP OTA defined notification is sent if an attribute value in
the application descriptor is not equal to the value of the
corresponding attribute in the manifest. </li>
</ul>
<p> If the content handler or application ID is not provided by the
application then the implementation is required to provide a value. The
default ID value is formed as the concatenation of the value of the <code>MIDlet-Vendor</code>
attribute followed by a hyphen ("-" = U+002D) and the value of the <code>MIDlet-Name</code>
attribute followed by a hyphen ("-" = U+002D) and the <code>classname</code>.
All spaces (" " = U+0020) must be translated to underscore ("_" =
U+005F).</p>
<p> The <code>MicroEdition-Handler-&lt;n&gt;-ID</code> attribute
contains the content handler ID. If the MIDlet suite is trusted, then
this attribute and value must be present in both the manifest and
application descriptor and the values must be the equal or it must not
appear at all. If not present in either the application descriptor or
manifest, the implementation MUST supply a default ID as defined above
using the classname from the <code>MicroEdition-Handler-&lt;n&gt;</code>
attribute.
</p>
<p> MIDP applications that do not register as content handlers need an
application ID to be allowed access to restricted content handlers. The
<code>MIDlet-&lt;n&gt;-ID</code> attribute contains the application ID
for the MIDlet registered with the <code>MIDlet-&lt;n&gt;</code>
attribute. When the application has gained access to the Registry the
ID is available using the <A HREF="../../../javax/microedition/content/Registry.html#getID()"><CODE>Registry.getID</CODE></A> method. If
the MIDlet suite is trusted, then this attribute and value must be
present in both the manifest and application descriptor and the values
must be the equal or it must not appear at all. If an ID is not
provided, the implementation MUST supply a default ID as defined above
using the <code>classname</code> in the <code>MIDlet-&lt;n&gt;</code>
attribute.</p>
<p>The user friendly application name MUST be provided by <A HREF="../../../javax/microedition/content/ContentHandler.html#getAppName()"><CODE>ContentHandler.getAppName</CODE></A>. If the content handler's classname is also
registered as a MIDlet using a <tt>MIDlet-&lt;n&gt;</tt> attribute
then the application name is the <tt>name</tt> (first) value of the
attribute, otherwise, the application name is the value of the <tt>MIDlet-Name</tt>
attribute.
</p>
<p>Updates to content handlers are treated the same as updates to any
MIDlet suite. The updated content handlers MUST be successfully
registered. If there are any dynamic registrations, then they MUST be
retained across further upgrades unless superseded by a new static
registration for the same classname. Retained dynamic registrations
are considered to be defined in the updated application.</p>
<p>A trusted MIDlet suite MUST request and be granted the <tt>javax.microedition.content.ContentHandler</tt>
permission to perform either static or dynamic registrations consistent
with the device's security policy. The <code>Registry.register</code>
method MUST throw a <code>java.lang.SecurityException</code> if the
permission is not granted.</p>
The permission, <tt>javax.microedition.content.ContentHandler</tt>,
for registering content handlers SHOULD be included in the <tt>auto-invocation</tt>
function group as defined in the MIDP 2.0 Recommended Security Policy
and later versions.
The policy allows an untrusted application to register handlers with a
user prompt each time (oneshot). For trusted applications, the user can
also choose blanket and session interaction modes.
<p>The MIDP specification defines the concept of a Trusted MIDlet suite
in which the AMS is able to authenticate the application. The mechanism
defined as "Trusted MIDlet Suites Using X.509 PKI" is one mechanism for
authenticating a MIDlet suite. When the AMS can authenticate the MIDlet
suite, it MUST be considered authenticated for the purposes of this
API. The authority for a signed MIDlet suite is the value of the
Subject field of the signing certificate. An application gets the
authority using the <A HREF="../../../javax/microedition/content/ContentHandler.html#getAuthority()"><CODE>ContentHandler.getAuthority</CODE></A> method. The format of the authority for
X.509 certificates is defined by the MIDP 2.0 Printable Representation
of X.509 Distinguished Names as defined in class <code>javax.microedition.pki.Certificate</code>.

<!--  Draft Text for CDC functions NOT part of CHAPI MR 1.0.1 

<h2>Content Handlers and the CDC based FP and PBP </h2>
<p>CHAPI implementations on CDC and including FP and PBP MUST support 
    retrieval and installation of application packages that include content handlers. 
    For FP, Content Handlers must use the lifecycle based on a 
    <code>main</code> method. For PBP, content handlers must use a 
    lifecycle based either on <code>main</code> or <code>xlet</code> methods.
    During the installation of an
    application package, each content handler MUST be registered using the
    CHAPI specific attributes in the Application Package.
    The implementation MUST provide and 
    register one or more content handler(s) to perform the installation for the
    application package types supported by the implementation.
</p>

<p>Application Packages containing Content handlers MUST be installable.
Any failure related to content handler registration attributes or
incorrect or invalid information related to installation must cause
the installation to fail. Conditions include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        If there is a conflict between
        the ID of any handler in the MIDlet suite being installed and handlers
        of existing MIDlet suites so the required content handler registrations
        cannot be performed, then the installation MUST fail. 
    </li>
    <li>
        If any of the content handler
        specific attributes are missing or cannot be parsed correctly or have
        values that are not valid to register the content handler then the
        installation must fail. This includes at least the values for types,
        suffixes, IDs, and actions. 
    </li>
</ul>

<p>The <code>MicroEdition-Handler-&lt;n&gt;-ID</code> 
attribute contains the content handler ID. If the content
handler ID is not present, the implementation MUST
supply a default ID. The default ID is implementation specific.
Applications that rely on the access control mechanisms 
should supply their own IDs.</p>

<p>Applications that do not register as content handlers need an
application ID to be allowed access to access restricted content handlers.
<b>TODO: The CDC Monaco AMS does not define an ID for applications that
    are not content handlers.  
    It is not correct to use MicroEdition-Handler-n-ID.
</b> 
The <code><strike>MicroEdition-Handler-&lt;n&gt;-ID</strike></code>
attribute contains the application ID. When the application
has gained access to the Registry, the ID is available using the
<code>Registry.getID</code>method. If an ID is not provided, the
implementation MUST supply a default ID. The default ID for an
application that is not a content handler is implementation specific.
Applications that rely on the access control mechanisms 
should supply their own IDs.</p>

<p>The user friendly application name MUST be provided by
<code>ContentHandler.getAppName</code>.
The value of the application name is implementation dependent.</p>

<p>Application packages containing content handlers are updated
in the same way as updates to any Application Package. The updated content
handlers MUST be successfully registered. If the installed application package
has any dynamic
registrations, then they MUST be retained across the upgrade unless
superseded by a new static registration for the same classname.</p>

<p>An application MUST be granted the
<code>javax.microedition.content.ContentHandlerPermission</code>
permission to perform either static or dynamic registrations
consistent with the device's security policy. 
The <code>Registry.register</code> method MUST
throw a <code>java.lang.SecurityException</code> if the permission is not granted.
<b>TODO: Exactly what, when is the checkPermission performed?</b>

The authority for a signed application is the value of the Subject field of the signing
certificate of the class registered as the content handler. An
application gets the authority using the <code>ContentHandler.getAuthority</code> method.</p>

<h3>Example of an Application Manifest</h3>
<p>A manifest file is a text file that
you can create with any text editor. Its lines have this syntax:</p>
<p><i>attribute</i><tt>:</tt><i>value</i></p>
<p>The following is an example of the contents of a manifest file. The <b>bold</b>
text indicates additions to support content handlers.</p>
<pre><code>
Main-Class: example.imageviewer
<b>MicroEdition-Handler-1: example.imageviewer.ImageViewer, image/png, .png, open, en-US fr fi-FI</b>
<b>MicroEdition-Handler-1-en-US: Open</b>
<b>MicroEdition-Handler-1-fr: Voir</b>
<b>MicroEdition-Handler-1-fi-FI: Avaa</b>
<b>MicroEdition-Handler-1-ID: com.sun.example.imageviewer</b>
<b>MicroEdition-Handler-1-Access: com.sun.example</b>
<b>MicroEdition-Handler-2: example.Browser, text/html, .html, open, en-US</b>
<b>MicroEdition-Handler-2-en-US: Open</b> </code></pre>

<p>The manifest file has these attributes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Manifest-Version - The manifest version number.</li>
  <li>Created-By - The Java version which created the JAR manifest and the name of the company which created the JAR utility.</li>
  <li>Main-Class - The JAR file's main class.</li>
  <li><b>MicroEdition-Handler-&lt;n&gt;</b> - A content handler registration for this JAR file.</li>
  <li><b>MicroEdition-Handler-&lt;n&gt;-&lt;locale&gt;</b> - The localized names of actions.</li>
  <li><b>MicroEdition-Handler-&lt;n&gt;-ID</b> - The ID of the content handler application.</li>
  <li><b>MicroEdition-Handler-&lt;n&gt;-Access</b> - The IDs of applications that are allowed access and visibility to the content handlers.</li>
</ul>

<p>For the Foundation and Personal Basis profiles, the AMS must handle installation
of content handlers.</p>
<p>If the content handler or application ID is
not provided by the application, then the implementation is required
to provide a value. 
The default value formed is implementation dependent.</p>
<p style="">For signed CDC
applications, it is the subject of the signing certificate of the
class registered as the content handler.</p>
