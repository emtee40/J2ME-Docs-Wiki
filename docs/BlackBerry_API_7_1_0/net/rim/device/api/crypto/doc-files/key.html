<P> This tutorial covers several diverse
    subject areas: keys, cryptosystems, certificates,
    and keystores. Each of the sections are summarized briefly below:
</P>

<p><ul>
    <li><A href="#keys">Keys</A> - private/public keys, key pairs, and symmetric
  keys. This includes how to create keys and how to manipulate them for the many
  different applications they have throughout the Crypto API. Remember, the best
  cryptography is based upon the secrecy of the key (or the private part of the
  key).
    <li><A href="#cryptosystems">CryptoSystems</A> - the CryptoSystems are used
  by all of the key systems for storing parameters for those specific keys.
  These are described in detail in this section.
    <li><A href="#certificates">Certificates</A> - the Crypto API provides an
  extensive certificate framework which is described in this section. This
  includes X509 certificates as well as others.
    <li><A href="#keystores">KeyStores</A> - a key store is used to store keys. This lesson will describe
	  the architecture of the keystore classes and their usefulness.</li></ul>

<p>	Keys provide the security behind any component in the Crypto API.  Today, the standard for cryptography
	dictates that only the key should provide the security. The concept of "security by obscurity," or hiding
	details about the algorithm or implementation is not acceptable. That being said, keys are the
	most important part of the Crypto API as well as one of the simplest parts of the API.  Most of the examples
	and sample code given throughout the entire tutorial will demonstrate how to create the appropriate keys
	for each algorithm.</p>

<p> In the Crypto API, <code>Key</code> is an interface. Subinterfaces for various different types of
	keys can be found extending from the Key interface.  The important subinterfaces to take note of
	are:
	<ul>
		<li><a href="../PublicKey.html">Public Key</a>
		<p>	The public key provides the concept of a key that can have its contents divulged to anyone.
			Public keys are used only in asymmetric key cryptography, where the public key and private
			key are different. In this scenario, the private key contains all of the secret information.</p>
		<li><a href="../PrivateKey.html">Private Key</a>
		<p>	As mentioned above, the private key contains all of the secret information in asymmetric key
			cryptography.  Its contents must be protected.</p>
		<li><a href="../SymmetricKey.html">Symmetric Key</a>
		<p>	In symmetric key cryptography the keys for encrypting and decrypting are identical and, hence,
			symmetric.  In this case, the key must be protected with as much
			zeal as a private key since all security is based upon this secret.</p></li>
	</ul>

<p>	The first common question is: "How do I create a new key?" whether that key is an RSA key or a DES key.
	Below are two code samples that will create an RSA key and a DES key. These
	examples can be slightly modified to create a DSA key or an AES key.</p>

<p><b>Creating a DES Key</b></p>
<p> The steps for creating a <a href="../DESKey.html">DES key</a> from scratch as well as from a known key are simple:
</p><PRE>
    // uses random data to create the key.
    DESKey unknownKey = new DESKey();

    // data contains the known key.
    byte[] data = new byte[ 8 ];
    DESKey knownKey = new DESKey( data );
</PRE>

</TABLE>
<p>Cryptosystems are used by all the public key cryptographic algorithms (e.g. RSA, DSA, ECDSA, etc) to hold public information common to all users within
a cryptographic community or system. Typically the cryptosystem holds some mathematical numbers that each user's computer must know for the cryptographic
calculations to succeed.
<p> The cryptosystems allow the developer to ignore many of the
    little details involved in using and creating keys.  But,
    by the same token, they also allow the developer to specify every single
    possible parameter for the keys.  To be exact, the cryptosystems
    provide a unique compromise between hiding details when desired and allowing
    access to those details when required.</p>

<p> The use of the CryptoSystem classes is easy to comprehend,
    but is very specific to the key system that is being used.  There are several crypto systems defined:
    <ul>
    <li><a href="../RSACryptoSystem.html">RSACryptoSystem</a>,
    <li><a href="../DSACryptoSystem.html">DSACryptoSystem</a>,
    <li><a href="../ECCryptoSystem.html">ECCrypoSystem</a>,
    <li><a href="../DHCryptoSystem.html">DHCryptoSystem</a>.
    </ul>
    </p>

<p> The <a href="../RSACryptoSystem.html">RSACryptoSystem</a> is the simplest in that it only contains
    the information for the size of the modulus. Using the RSACryptoSystem is very simple,
    as demonstrated by the following code:
</p>
<pre>
    RSACryptoSystem rsaCryptoSystem = new RSACryptoSystem(1024);
</pre>
<p><b>Creating an RSA keypair</b></p>
<p>With an RSACryptoSystem, we can create an <a href="../RSAKeyPair.html">RSA keypair</a> with the following code</p>
<pre>
    RSAKeyPair rsaKeyPair = new RSAKeyPair( rsaCryptoSystem );
</pre>
<p>	One could also get the private and public keys that were just created by:<br>
<pre>
    RSAPublicKey rsaPublicKey = rsaKeyPair.getRSAPublicKey();
    RSAPrivateKey rsaPrivateKey = rsaKeyPair.getRSAPrivateKey();
</pre>
<P></P>

<p> Now, to complete the discussion of examples using RSA, a public key with a known
    n and e will be created:</p>
<pre>
    // A key with modulus 1024 bits in length.
    RSACryptoSystem rsaCryptoSystem = new RSACryptoSystem(1024);
    // where n and e are byte arrays
    RSAPublicKey rsaPublicKey = new RSAPublicKey( rsaCryptoSystem, e, n );
</pre>

<p> Notice that, when creating an existing RSA public key, we have the n and e stored in a byte
    array format.  This is intended to give developers the most flexibility, as most classes can
    be converted into a byte array.</p>


<p> To create a <a href="../DSACryptoSystem.html">DSACryptoSystem</a>, we need more information.  The DSA
    key system relies on system parameters that are not typically sent
    with each message request due to their size. Parties tend to agree
    on common parameters so that they do not have to be sent every time.  This
    is where the cryptosystem comes into play.  These constant parameters
    can be stored in the cryptosystem, representing P, Q and G.
    Due to the rigorous mathematics involved, this lesson does not explain the
    meaning of these parameters. For more information, see the
    <A href="http://www.cacr.math.uwaterloo.ca/hac/">Handbook of Applied Cryptography</A>.

<p> To use the DSACryptoSystem there are two constructors.  The first uses the default parameters
    (which are shown in the code sample below as byte arrays) and hides the
    details involved:
<pre>
    DSACryptoSystem system = new DSACryptoSystem();
</pre>
<p> The other constructor can be used by the developer who wishes to specify the parameters to use.
    For this example, the constructor is called with what happen to be the default values for
    p, q and g:
</p>
<pre>
    /* 1024-bit key parameters */
    private static final byte[] p = new byte[] {
        (byte)0xfd, (byte)0x7f, (byte)0x53, (byte)0x81, (byte)0x1d, (byte)0x75, (byte)0x12, (byte)0x29,

<p> This is a brief introduction to certificates and their implementation.
    It is not a definitive guide on using certificates, but is meant to
    give the reader an idea of what to expect from our certificate
    implementation.</p>

<p> A certificate is an object that binds an entity's identity to their public key.  The entity can then
    use this certificate as a way of handing out their public key to anyone who would like to
    use it.  In order to ensure that a certificate is authentic, it is signed by what's known as
    a Certificate Authority ( CA ).  The CA is trusted and, since they sign the certificate, the certificate
    is trusted.  Someone wishing to use a certificate can verify the CA's signature to ensure they
    are using the correct key.
</p>

<p> There are several different standards currently available for
    certificates, two of which will be described. The two
    implemented at this time are <a href="../certificate/x509/X509Certificate.html">X509</a>, and
    <a href="../certificate/wtls/WTLSCertificate.html">WTLS</a>
    because they are the most popular and most common certificate formats available.
    That being said, there is an easy and simple way for implementing
    other certificates given our <a href="../certificate/Certificate.html">Certificate</a> interface. Instead of describing
    these certificates, which have features that are clearly specific to
    each type of certificate, the general certificate interface will be discussed.

<tr><td>
<p>
	The user has a few ways of creating a certificate.  If they are given the encoding of, for example, an X509
    Certificate, they can create it as follows :<p>

    <pre>
    byte[] encoding = ...
    X509Certificate certificate = new X509Certificate( encoding );
    </pre>
    You can also create a certificate from its encoding using a Certificate Factory.  Suppose you have the encoding
    and know that it is a "X509", then you can instantiate the certificate as follows :
    <pre>
    InputStream encoding = ...
    Certificate certificate = CertificateFactory.getInstance( "X509", encoding );
    </pre>
    As a side note, the Certificate Factory comes preloaded with knowing how to read X509 and WTLS Certificates.  Other
    types of certificates can be registered with the certificate factory.  For more discussion of extending the crypto
    api, please refer to the <a href="crypto_ext_startpage.html">extending the crypto api tutorial.</a>
    <p>
    Finally, if you would like to make a new X509 Certificate, the API provides for that feature with the
    <code>X509Certificate.createCertificate()</code> call.  For example, to create a root certificate ( ie. a
    certifiate where the issuer and subject are the same ), you could do the following :
    <pre>
    RSAKeyPair keyPair = new RSAKeyPair( new RSACryptoSystem() );
    X509DistinguishedName name = new X509DistinguishedName( "O=ACME Corp., C=Canada" );
    long keyUsage = KeyUsage.KEY_CERT_SIGN;
    byte[] serialNumber = new byte[] { (byte)0x01 };
    long validNotBefore = System.currentTimeMillis();
    long validNotAfter = validNotBefore + 1000*60*60*24*365;		// add a year of milliseconds
    X509Certificate root = X509Certificate.createX509Certificate( keyPair, name, keyUsage, serialNumber, null,
    validNotBefore, validNotAfter );
    </pre>
</tr></td>
<tr><td>
	The <code>equals()</code> method can be used to determine if one certificate is equal to another.
    This would typically result in comparing all of the fields internal to the
    certificate to determine if this were true.<br><br>
</tr></td>
<tr><td>
    The <code>getEncoding()</code> method returns the encoded format of the certificate.  If it were
    an X509 certificate, getEncoding() would return the X509 encoding of the certificate information.<br><br>
</tr></td>
<tr><td>
    The <code>getPublicKey()</code> method extracts the public key associated with the certificate
    (every certificate must have a public key associated with it) and returns this
    key for use. <br><br>
</tr></td>
<tr><td>
    The <code>verify()</code> method is the most useful and important method in this class. Given a certificate,
    it verifies that certificate with the appropriate means.  For example,
    with X509 certificates it would check to ensure that the CA's signature was valid and then
    return the result.<br><br>
</tr></td>
<tr><td>
    The certificate api also supports the concept of certificate chains.  You can create a certificate chain
    in various ways.
    <p>
    The first way is if you have all the certificates as individual objects, then you can just put them in an array :
    <pre>
    Certificate endEntity = ...
    Certificate firstCA = ...
    Certificate rootCA = ...
    Certificate[] chain = new Certificate[] { endEntity, firstCA, rootCA };
    </pre>
    Or, you can use the build certificate chain utility, found in
    <a href="../certificate/CertificateUtilities.html">CertificateUtilities</a>.  For example, if you
    had one of the CAs, in an array of certificates, and the other CA in a key store, you could create the certificate chain
    as follows :
    <pre>
    Certificate endEntity = ...
    Certificate[] pool = ... ( contains firstCA )
    KeyStore keyStore = ... ( contains rootCA )
    Certificate[] chain = CertificateUtilities.buildCertChain( endEntity, pool, keyStore );
    </pre>
    Then, you can determine if the chain is trusted ( ie. if you trust one of the certificates in the chain ) with the
    following :
    <pre>
    KeyStore trustedKeyStore = TrustedKeyStore.getInstance();
    boolean trusted = CertificateUtilities.isCertificateChainTrusted( chain, trustedKeyStore )
    </pre>
    or you can try and create a trusted certificate chain directly :
    <pre>
    Certificate endEntity = ...
    Certificate[] pool = ... ( contains firstCA )
    KeyStore keyStore = ... ( contains rootCA )
    KeyStore trustedKeyStore = TrustedKeyStore.getInstance();
    Certificate[] trustedChain = CertificateUtilities.buildTrustedCertChain( endEntity, pool,
    									     keyStore, trustedKeyStore );
    </pre>
</tr></td>
<tr><td>
    Another feature supported by the certificate api is that of certificate status.  Each certificate on the handheld
    can be given a <a href="../certificate/CertificateStatus.html">CertificateStatus</a>.  These indicate if the status
    of the certificate is good, revoked, or unknown.  All of the status' are mangaged by the
    <a href="../keystore/CertificateStatusManager.html">CertificateStatusManager</a>.
</tr></td>
</table>
<p>
   Overall, the Certificate API provides for a wide variety of features and options for the user to explore.

<p> A key store is a class which helps the developer store
    keys in an efficient and effective manner on the device.
    That is what the KeyStore classes accomplish in the Crypto API.
<p>

<p> These classes are currently made up of three different
    components.  The first component is the <a href="../keyStore/KeyStore.html">KeyStore</a> interface, which
    sets the stage for any other key store that is to be
    implemented for the Crypto API.  It provides functions that
    will store and retrieve keys and certificates.  It is very similar to the implementation
    used for Java 1.3, Standard Edition, but there are slight variations for
    storing specific kinds of keys found in the Crypto API, such
    as public keys or private keys.</p>

<p> The second component of the KeyStore classes is the <a href="../keyStore/RIMKeyStore.html">RIMKeyStore</a> class.
    This class is the implementation of the KeyStore interface discussed above
    and is provided as a default implementation.</p>

<p> The third component of the KeyStore classes is the <a href="../keyStore/TrustedKeyStore.html">TrustedKeyStore</a> class.
    This class is provides secure storage for trusted certificates and public keys without the possibility
    of tampering.  The public interface to the class only provides get methods
    to retrieve the certificates and public keys.  This is incredibly useful for applications
    such as browsers, where root certificates for all of the CAs are preloaded into the browser.
    This ability to preload certificates ensures that people can trust the certificates in
    the browser since they were shipped with the product.</p>
