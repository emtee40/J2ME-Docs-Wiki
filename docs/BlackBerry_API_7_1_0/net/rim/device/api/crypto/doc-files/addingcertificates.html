<p> Certificates provide a means of transmitting public keys in a package that can be
    signed for authenticity by a Certificate Authority (CA) and subsequently verified by
    a third party.  They ensure that, on the authority of the CA, the public key belongs
    to the entity claiming ownership.
</p>

<p><b>Adding Certificates</b></p>

<p> The process of adding certificates to the Crypto API is more involved that simply providing
    support for another encoding format.  There are several steps that must be taken:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>The <a href = "../certificate/certificate.html"><code>Certificate</code></a>
         interface must be implemented.</li>
    <li><code>PublicKeyEncoder</code> and <code>PublicKeyDecoder</code> classes must be provided for
        the public keys that the new certificate format will use.</li>
    <li>Signature encoding support must be provided by implementing the appropriate
        <code>SignatureEncoder</code> and <code>SigantureDecoder</code> classes.</li>
</ul>

<p> The <code>Certificate</code> class provides the base interface for all certificates and the
    ability to retrieve the public key, verify the certificate, and check for validity, among
    other features.  To implement a specific certificate, simply implement the interface and
    provide all the code necessary to process and format it.  An example of a certificate is
    the <a href = "../certificate/X509/X509Certificate.html"><code>X509Certificate</code></a>.
</p>

<p> Since certificates contain public keys, there must be <code>PublicKeyEncoder</code>s and
    <code>PublicKeyDecoder</code>s associated with the certificate that provide the encoding
    in the expected format.  An example of such encoders for the X.509 certificate would be the
    <code>X509_EC_PublicKeyEncoder</code> and <code>X509_EC_PublicKeyDecoder</code> classes.
    Note that these encoders follow the naming scheme described in <a href = "addingencoding.html">
    Adding Encoding Schemes to the API</a>, with the algorithm name preceding the rest of the
    class name with an underscore.  Any given key type that can be used in the certificate must have
    an associated encoder and decoder for that given encoding algorithm.
</p>

<p> Finally, signature encoding and decoding classes must be provided for verification of
    the certificate's signature. Once again, an example is the X.509 implementation of
    the <code>X509_SignatureEncoder</code> and <code>X509_SignatureDecoder</code> classes.
