        <b>RIM Crypto API: Stream Ciphers</b></FONT>
    </TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>

<p> The stream ciphers portion of the Crypto API is based upon the common
    stream interface in Java, with the familiar read and write function calls used to interact
    with the stream.  Once a stream cipher is established, all activity is
    performed by the class on the underlying stream with no intervention
    or work required by the developer.
</p>
<p>
    This lesson describes the common uses of
    stream ciphers in the Crypto API and provides sample code for using them.
    First, the PseudoRandomSource class and its advantages will be discussed.
    The second part will demonstrate ARC4 (the alleged RC4 algorithm), as this is
    one of the most common requests.  The final section will show how to use
    CFB mode for block ciphers.
</p>

<p><b>Pseudo-Random Sources</b></p>
<p> A pseudo-random source is essentially a bit stream generator which is initialized with a seed and supplies an arbitrarily
    long stream of hopefully unpredictable and non-repeating bits.
</p>
<p>
    The <a href="../PseudoRandomSource.html">PseudoRandomSource</a> interface represents a
    pseudo-random number generator (PRNG).  This interface provides methods for
    retrieving bytes from the PRNG and resetting the state of the PRNG.
</p>
<p><b>Stream Ciphers</b></p>
    Most Stream Ciphers simple create the ciphertext by exclusive-or'ing the plaintext with a keystream. The keystream is generated from
    a pseudo-random number generator.
</p>

<p><b>The ARC4 Stream Cipher</b></p>
<p> To use the ARC4 algorithm, we need to use an instance of the <a href="../ARC4PseudoRandomSource.html">ARC4PseudoRandomSource</a>
    class.
    While ARC4PseudoRandomSource could be used directly to encrypt data, the more flexible and
    reliable way involves using the <a href="../PRNGEncryptor.html">PRNGEncryptor</a> class, which extends the
    <a href="../StreamEncryptor.html">StreamEncryptor</a>
    class.  All encryption can then be done by making simple calls to write.
    The sample code for this should make the process clear:
</p>
<pre>
    // Input byte array.
    byte[] plaintext = new byte[128];

    // For now we will just use the Random source to get input bytes when, in
    // reality, this would be plaintext.  This effectively shows how to use
    // RandomSource as well.
    RandomSource.getBytes( plaintext );

    // Print out the plaintext.
    System.out.println("Plaintext = " + new String( plaintext ) + ".");

    // Now set up the ARC4Key of length 256 bytes.
    ARC4Key key = new ARC4Key( 256 );

    // Now create the ARC4PseudoRandomSource
    ARC4PseudoRandomSource source = new ARC4PseudoRandomSource( key );

    // Create the output stream to store the encrypted data
    ByteArrayOutputStream out = new ByteArrayOutputStream();

    // Finally, create the PRNGEncryptor stream encryptor, which uses
    // the ARC4PseudoRandomSource and an output stream
    PRNGEncryptor encryptStream = new PRNGEncryptor( source, out );

    // To encrypt, simply call write with the plaintext
    encryptStream.write( plaintext, 0, plaintext.length );
    encryptStream.close();

    byte[] ciphertext = out.toByteArray();

    // Print out the ciphertext.
    System.out.println( "Ciphertext = " + new String(ciphertext) + "." );
</pre>
<p> Decryption is similar:</p>
<pre>
    // Reload the key to get the ciphertext back to plaintext (decrypt).
    source = new ARC4PseudoRandomSource( key );

    // Create an input stream with ciphertext as the basis
    ByteArrayInputStream in = new ByteArrayInputStream( ciphertext );

    // Create an instance of an PRNGDecryptor to decrypt the data
    PRNGDecryptor decryptStream = new PRNGDecryptor( source, in );

    // Decrypt by reading from the stream and storing
    // the decrypted data in plaintext
    decryptStream.read( plaintext, 0, ciphertext.length );
    decryptStream.close();

    // Print out the plaintext.
    System.out.println( "Plaintext = " + new String( plaintext ) + "." );
</pre>

<p><b>Using CFB Mode</b></p>
<p> <a href="../CFBEncryptor.html">Cipher Feedback (CFB)</a> mode is a common mode used to convert a block cipher to a stream cipher.
 The following sample code shows how to encrypt using CFB mode:
</p>
<pre>
    // We are going to use DES since it seems to be the most common
    // symmetric key algorithm used.

    // Setup the input again as random bytes.
    byte[] input = new byte[128];
    RandomSource.getBytes( input );

    // Setup the DESKEy.
    DESKey key = new DESKey();

    // Set up the DESEngine.
    DESEncryptorEngine engine1 = new DESEncryptorEngine( key );

    // Setup the Initialization vector.
    byte[] iv1 = { 0x01, 0x02, 0x03, 0x04, 0x05, 0x06, 0x07, 0x08 };

    // Set up the output stream.
    ByteArrayOutputStream outStream = new ByteArrayOutputStream();

    // Setup the encryptor.
    CFBEncryptor encryptor = new CFBEncryptor( engine1, new InitializationVector( iv1 ), outStream, true );

    // Write out the data to be encrypted.
    encryptor.write( input, 0, input.length );

    // Close the encryptor stream.
    encryptor.close();

    // Get the information from the underlying data stream.
    byte[] output = outStream.toByteArray();
    outStream.close();

    // Print out the input and the output.
    System.out.println("Plaintext = " + new String( input ) + ".");
    System.out.println("Ciphertext = " + new String( output ) + ".");
</pre>

<p> As is evident, more code is required to establish the infrastructure than is
    necessary to actually encrypt the data.  CFBEncryptor (or any class that implements
    StreamEncryptor) takes the data written to it via calls to write(), encrypts it, and
    writes that encrypted data to the output stream passed into the constructor (stream, in
    the code above).  This way, the complete, encrypted data can be passed into any desired
    output stream.
</p>
<p>
    To decrypt data encrypted using CFB, a similar process is followed:
</p>
<pre>
    // Use the same input and output byte array from above.
    // Also, use the same key as was used above.

    // Set up the DESEngine.
    DESEncryptorEngine engine2 = new DESEncryptorEngine( key );

    // Set up the Initialization vector.
    byte[] iv2 = { 0x01, 0x02, 0x03, 0x04, 0x05, 0x06, 0x07, 0x08 };

    // Set up the output stream.
    ByteArrayInputStream inStream = new ByteArrayInputStream( output );

    // Set up the encryptor.
    CFBDecryptor decryptor = new CFBDecryptor( engine2, new InitializationVector( iv2 ), inStream, true );

    // Read in the data to be decrypted.
    decryptor.read( input, 0, input.length );

    // Close the encryptor stream.
    decryptor.close();
    inStream.close();

    // Print out the input and the output.
    System.out.println("Plaintext = " + new String( input ) + ".");
</pre>
