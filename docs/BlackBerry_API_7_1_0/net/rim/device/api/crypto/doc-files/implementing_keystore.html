<strong>Notes on implementing your own keyStore</strong>
<p>
Before starting to write your own KeyStore, consider the keyStore implementations
that are available from RIM. RIM provides a variety of flexible and powerful keyStore solutions that allow you to develop an effective custom solution. That being said, the importance of third party development is paramount. This tutorial provides some hints and tips on how to implement your own
keystore.

<p>

<strong>Implementing your own <a href = "../keystore/KeyStore.html">KeyStore</a> class</strong>
<p>
The <code>set</code> method is the work horse of the keyStore class since it is used to add elements to the keyStore. The <code>KeyStore</code> interface contains a number of instances When developing your own keystore it is a good idea to create one <b>private</b> <code>set</code> method that allows for all of the possible parameters. Then, each <b>public</b> set method will simply call the <b>private</b> <code>set</code> method. This way, you can implement the main method only once and call it numerous times with a subset of the actual parameters.
<p>
Once you have determined how to enter data into the keyStore, you need to consider how the data will be accessed. This is accomplished using the <code>KeyStoreIndex</code> class. The <code>KeyStoreIndex</code> class is added to the KeyStore along with the data elements. See <a href = "tutorial_keystoreindex.html">Indexing the KeyStore</a> for a tutorial on using the KeyStore index.
<p>
Tickets provide time sensitive credentials for a user. A valid ticket allows the user associated with the ticket to perform bulk operations in the <code>KeyStore</code> or <code>KeyStoreData</code> without the need to request the password each and every time.
<p>
The RIM Crypto API contains three types of tickets:
<ul>
<LI>
 The KeyStore Ticket, (used for granting access within the keyStore)
<li>
The KeyStoreData ticket, (used for granting access to <code>KeyStoreData</code> records)
<li>
The KeyStorePassword ticket, (used for granting a user access to change the password)
</ul>
Tickets provide a type of hierarchy.
For example, when requesting access to the keyStore (using the <code>getTicket()</code> method) it will ask the <code>KeyStorePassword</code>
for a ticket. This will return a ticket (there are different methods provided in <code>KeyStorePassword</code> depending on what
you are requesting so that the prompt shows exactly what you are trying to get permission to) for the <code>KeyStorePassword</code>
class. The <code>KeyStore</code> ticket is then wrapped around this newly obtained ticket. That way, you can control
whether or not people who have received a ticket for the <code>KeyStorePassword</code> can actually access your <code>keyStore</code> or not. This is a achieved by wrapping the ticket around the <code>KeyStorePassword</code> ticket and then storing a reference to the <code>keyStore</code>
in that ticket.  On checking against the ticket during access you simply check to see if the keystore is the same.  If so, allow them access. If not, prompt them for another ticket or simply prompt for the password to make sure
they can access your keystore.
<p>
Also of note are the listeners. Listeners allow people to find out when records have been added or removed from
the keystore. This is useful, for example, for applications that add address book entries given certificates in your keystore.
<p>
<strong>Implementing your own <a href = "../keystore/KeyStoreData.html">KeyStoreData</a> class</strong>
<p>
The <code>KeyStoreData</code> class contains the actual keying information and acts as a general repository for other data
that might be associated with that key. As you can see from the javadocs there are some very obvious methods
that return the certificate, private key, public key, etc.
<p>
There are some things to take into consideration when implementing your own <code>KeyStoreData</code> class. First of all, the private key should be encrypted
when stored in the <code>KeyStore</code>. The key should be encrypted in the <code>KeyStoreData</code> constructor and decrypted in the <code>getPrivateKey()</code> method. This code can be found in <a href = "../keystore/KeyStorePasswordManager.html">KeyStorePasswordManager</a>.  It provides methods
for encrypting and decrypting that can be simply called.
<p>
The <code>KeyStoreData</code> class should also be immutable, or, without change. That means that there are no modifiers provided for
the class and that the class can not be modified in any way, by any user after the class has been created.

Another important consideration is the concept of <code>AssociatedData</code>. <code>AssociatedData</code> allows users to place things into the KeyStore record that are not necessarily known at design time. More importantly it allows people to place record-specific data in the keyStore
which they can then access by searching for the specific <code>AssociatedData</code> using an index.
<p>
For more information on using indexes, see <a href = "tutorial_keystoreindex.html">Using the KeyStore index</a>.
<p>

<strong>ChangePassword</strong>
<p>
This topic is one that is rather difficult in the keystore and it deserves its own section.
<p>
In order to change the password on the device we need to decrypt and re-encrypt all of the things
(note that I do not specify only keys since there may be other things in your keystore which are
encrypted) that rely on the password based encryption provided by the <code>KeyStorePassword</code> class.
<p>
The following chain of events will cause a change password.
<ol>
<li>
The user decides to change their password.
<li>
This causes the <code>KeyStorePassword.changePassword()</code> method to be called.
<br>It prompts for the old password and new password.<br>
<li>
If that succeeds (they know the old password) then the KeyStoreManager will be informed of a change password event.
<li>It goes through its list of keystores (which is why you are strongly suggested to register your keystore with the KeyStoreManager)
    and tells all of them that there is a changePassword operation occuring now.
<li>All of the <code>KeyStore</code>s loop through the elements in the <code>KeyStore</code> and tell each of the <code>KeyStoreData</code> records to change
    the password regarding any of the sensitive material in the KeyStore.
<li>The <code>KeyStoreData</code> objects call the <code>KeyStorePassword.changePassword( ... )</code> method that will decrypt and re-encrypt
    any encrypted objects with the new password.
</ol>
<p>
As you can see it is imperative that you maintain involvement in this process or else you run the risk of losing access to the
keys stored in the KeyStore.
<p>
<strong>General Notes</strong>
<p>
There are two major types of key stores: Non-persistable and persistable.
<p>
It is highly suggested that you register your <code>KeyStore</code> with the <code>KeyStoreManager</code> when your <code>KeyStore</code> is created.  If not, you
run the risk of losing access to the encrypted objects stored inside your <code>KeyStoreData</code> objects.  See the ChangePassword
section for more information.
<p>
Developers of KeyStores should respect the security level setting.  High security means that the user will always be prompted
(except in the case of tickets) for the password.  Low security means that the user will never be prompted.  Note that prompting
refers only to accessing the private key or encrypted <code>KeyStoreData</code> contents.   A <code>KeyStore</code> should *always* prompt when adding and removing records from the <code>KeyStore</code>.
