</TABLE>

<p> The RIM Crypto API was designed in such a way that a developer
    can easily use digests and MACs (Message
    Authentication Codes) and access their contents.  Unlike many
    of the encryption topics covered so far in this tutorial, they are
    relatively straightforward and easy to understand. This lesson describes
    the digests and MACs found in the API and
    provides code examples that show how to use them effectively.
</p>

<p><b>Digests</b></p>
<P>Digests are used to convert an arbitrary long piece of input data to a fixed size hash or digest. Strong digest algorithms make it hard to find two inputs that hash
to the same output, and make it hard to find an input that hashes to a particular digest value.
<p> The most commonly used hash function in North America
    is SHA-1, whose digest length is 160 bits. Recently, the NSA has developed
    a successor to SHA-1 called SHA-2.  SHA-2 has variable digest bit lengths of 256, 384 and 512 bits.
    These lengths match the security level of the upcoming release of the AES
    candidate (which is to replace DES).  We have implemented SHA-1 (in the class
    <code>SHA1Digest</code>), as well as all three variants of SHA-2 (in the classes
    <code>SHA256Digest</code>, <code>SHA384Digest</code> and <code>SHA512Digest</code>).
    The following example demonstrates how to use these classes.
</p>
<pre>
    // Instantiate any of the different types of SHA
    SHA1Digest digest160 = new SHA1Digest();
    SHA256Digest digest256 = new SHA256Digest();
    SHA384Digest digest384 = new SHA384Digest();
    SHA512Digest digest512 = new SHA512Digest();

    // Now we will simply use the SHA-1 algorithm to illustrate
    // how the rest of the functions work.
    byte[] data = new byte[128];
    RandomSource.getBytes( data );

    // Update the contents of the hash function
    // (This is the data that gets hashed)
    digest160.update( data );
    digest160.update( data, 10, 15 );

    // Now get the hash value.
    byte[] digestValue = digest160.getDigest();
</pre>
<p> We could also have retrieved the hash value using the following code:
</p>
<pre>
    byte[] hashValue = new byte[digest160.getDigestLength()];
    digest160.getDigest( hashValue, 0 );
</pre>
<p> There is another, perhaps even easier way to use digests.  This involves the use
    of the streaming support provided by <a href="../DigestInputStream.html">DigestInputStream</a> and <a href="../DigestOutputStream.html">DigestOutputStream</a>.
    Simply create an instance of a digest input or output stream, and pass an instance of
    a digest algorithm into the constructor:
</p>
<pre>
    // Create a SHA digest with the default length (160-bit).
    SHA1Digest digest = new SHA1Digest();

    // Now create a new DigestOutputStream.  Passing in a null value
    // for the OutputStream parameter means that this stream will
    // not pass the data written to it into another output stream; we
    // simply want to use the digest functionality.
    DigestOutputStream out = new DigestOutputStream( digest, null );

    // A call to write will also update the digest (assuming data exists
    // and contains the message)
    out.write( data );

    // Now get the hash value.
    byte[] digestValue = digest.getDigest();
</pre>

<p> This same method can be used for <a href="../DigestInputStream.html">DigestInputStream</a>, except that the data read from the
    input stream (passed into DigestInputStream) is passed through the digest algorithm.
</p>

<p><b>Support for Other Digests</b></p>

<p> The interface for all of the other digests in the API is the same.
    While SHA is the most common, the Crypto API supports
    the following hash algorithms:
    <UL>
    <LI> <a href="../MD2Digest.html">MD2 Digest</a>
    <LI> <a href="../MD4Digest.html">MD4 Digest</a>
    <LI> <a href="../MD5Digest.html">MD5 Digest</a>
    <LI> <a href="../SHA1Digest.html">SHA-1 Digest</a>
    <LI> <a href="../SHA256Digest.html">SHA-256 Digest</a>, <a href="../SHA384Digest.html">SHA-384 Digest</a>, <a href="../SHA512Digest.html">SHA-512 Digest</a>
    <LI> <a href="../RIPEMD128Digest.html">RIPEMD-128 Digest</a>, <a href="../RIPEMD160Digest.html">RIPEMD-160 Digest</a>
    </UL>
</p>

<p><b>Message Authentication Codes (MACs)</b></p>
<p> <a href="../MAC.html">MACs</a> are essentially keyed hash functions.  That is, a key
    is required for the creation of the hash value as well as for the
    verification of that particular hash value.  The MAC functionality in
    the Crypto API builds upon the digest interface, providing this
    additional functionality.
<p>
The Crypto API supports the following MACs:
<ul>
<li> <a href="../CBCMAC.html">CBC MAC</a>
<li> <a href="../HMAC.html">HMAC</a>
<li> <a href="../NullMAC.html">Null MAC</a>
</UL>

</P>
<p> The <a href="../HMAC.html">HMAC</a> class implements the MAC interface and allows for easy use of
    keyed hash functions.  The code required to use an HMAC is very similar
    to that for digests, except that a key is required to generate the hash:
</p>
<pre>
    // We need to create an HMAC key, which can be an array
    // of data of any length.  In most cases, a length equal
    // to the bit size of the digest is recommended.  Random
    // data will be used here.
    byte[] keyData = new byte[ 20 ];
    RandomSource.getBytes( keyData );

    // Create the key
    HMACKey key = new HMACKey( keyData );

    // Create the SHA digest
    SHA1Digest digest = new SHA1Digest();

    // Now an HMAC can be created, passing in the key and the
    // SHA digest. Any instance of a digest can be used here.
    HMAC hMac = new HMAC( key, digest );

    // The HMAC can be updated much like a digest
    hMac.update( data );
    hMac.update( data, 10, 15 );

    // Now get the MAC value.
    byte[] macValue = hMac.getMAC();
</pre>

<p> There is also streaming support for HMACs.  Assuming the HMAC object above has been created,
    a <a href="../MACOutputStream.html">MACOutputStream</a> could be used:

<pre>
    // Create the MAC output stream, once again passing in null for
    // the OutputStream in order to just use the MAC functionality
    MACOutputStream out = new MACOutputStream( hMac, null );

    // A call to write will also update the MAC (assuming data exists
    // and contains the message)
    out.write( data );

    // Now get the MAC value.
    byte[] macValue = hMac.getMAC();
</pre>

<p> Once again, a <a href="../MACInputStream.html">MACInputStream</a> class exists, which can be used in a similar fashion.
