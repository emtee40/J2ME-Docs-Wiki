<strong>Overview</strong><p>
This tutorial contains information on using and implementing a <code>KeyStoreIndex</code>.
The <code>KeyStoreIndex</code> is the main method for retrieving data from the
KeyStore especially in cases where you want only the <code>KeyStoreData</code> records
that contain specific properties. The <code>KeyStoreIndex</code> allows you to perform customizable queries on <code>KeyStoreData</code> objects to return highly specific data sets. For instance, a typical query might return all records that have private keys, or all records that contain a specific value.
<p>
<strong>Tutorial</strong><P>
In order to understand how to implement an effective <code>KeyStoreIndex</code>, it is important
that you be familiar with how to use one.  Below you will find some
example code and a walkthrough that will add an index (the LabelKeyStoreIndex) and uses it
to retrieve data from the KeyStore.
<p>

First, a new keystore is created called "My Test KeyStore". Since the keystore is initially empty, a new keypair is created. The keypair is of type DSA.

<pre>
    try {
        // Create a new KeyStore that we are going to use for our test program.
        RIMKeyStore keyStore = new RIMKeyStore( "My Test KeyStore" );

        // Create a new key pair that we are going to place in the KeyStore.
        DSAKeyPair keyPair = new DSAKeyPair( new DSACryptoSystem() );

</pre>
Next the key-pair is added into the keystore using the <a href = "../keystore/keystore.html#set(net.rim.device.api.crypto.keystore.AssociatedData[], java.lang.String, net.rim.device.api.crypto.PrivateKey, java.lang.String, int, net.rim.device.api.crypto.PublicKey, long, net.rim.device.api.crypto.keystore.KeyStoreTicket)">set</a> method. In the example, the set method takes as parameters: <code>null</code> which designates that there is no associated data with this keystore entry, a String representing - the label for the entry, the private key and <code>null</code> which designates the default encoding algorithm (PKCS8), The keystore security level (in this case set to High), and the public key. The KeyUsage is not specified (in this case specified as 0) and a ticket was not passed into the method.
<p>
Once the new entry is set, the index must be added to the KeyStore. This is accomplished using the <a href = "../keystore/keystore.html#addIndex(net.rim.device.api.crypto.keystore.KeyStoreIndex)">addIndex</a> method and specifying the index to be added. Below, a LabelKeyStoreIndex is added to the KeyStore.


<pre>
        keyStore.set( null, "John Smith", keyPair.getPrivateKey(), null, KeyStore.HIGH, keyPair.getPublicKey(), 0, null );

        // add the index to the keystore.
        keyStore.addIndex( new LabelKeyStoreIndex() );
</pre>

Now that the item has been added to the keyStore, the index can be used to retrieve it. We can assume in this case, since there is only one entry in the keyStore, that all labels will uniquely identify the entry. Ofcourse, this is not always the case.
<p>
Below, the <a href = "../keystore/keystore.html#elements(long, java.lang.Object)">elements</a> method is used to return an enumeration of all items containing the String "John Smith". The method accepts the ID of the LabelKeyStoreIndex (specified by LabelKeyStoreIndex.ID) and the String to search for. The method returns an enumeration of items containing the label "John Smith" that are currently contained in that keystore.  If there are no labels in the keystore with that label then it will return an EmptyEnumeration.


<pre>

        Enumeration enum = keyStore.get( LabelKeyStoreIndex.ID, "John Smith" );
</pre>

To view the results, loop through the enumeration to get the KeyStoreData record associated with each label. The labels, or in this case label, are printed out to the console.

<pre>
	  while( enum.hasMoreElements() ) {
            KeyStoreData data = (KeyStoreData)enum.nextElement();
            System.out.println("KeyStoreData Label = " + data.getLabel() );
        }
</pre>
<p>
Below, the index is used to retrieve all records in the keyStore with labels.
Since the keyStore contains only one element, it will print out exactly
what we printed out earlier. However, this syntax would be more important if we used the
        <code>PrivateKeysKeyStoreIndex</code> which would return all of the KeyStoreData records that contained
        a private key


<pre>
        enum = keyStore.elements( LabelKeyStoreIndex.ID );

	  while( enum.hasMoreElements() ) {
            KeyStoreData data = (KeyStoreData)enum.nextElement();
            System.out.println("KeyStoreData Label = " + data.getLabel() );
        }
    } catch( CryptoException e ) {
        // There was a problem with the sample code.
        System.out.println( "CryptoException: " + e );
    }
</pre>

<p>
Now that you are familiar with how to use an index we can show you how to implement an index.
Below we have provided our implementation of the LabelKeyStoreIndex which will index all of the
KeyStoreData records by their labels.  The KeyStoreIndex code will be called when you attempt to add
the index to the keystore.  We showed above how you would use this index and below you can see
from the comments and the source code exactly how this index is to be implemented and how that
corresponds to its use.
