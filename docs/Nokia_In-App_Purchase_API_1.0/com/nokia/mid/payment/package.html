<P> In-app purchase offers a simple and seamless integration of a payment event into an application. While using the application,
    end users (consumers) will be able to purchase additional digital content directly from the application, without having to leave the application.
    A payment event can be started from the application. If the payment is successful, the newly purchased content or service is added to the application.
    The application developer is responsible for defining the price and description of the products, and for controlling the access rights to premium features.
    In-app purchase supports all current Nokia Store account payment methods, including credit and debit cards, and operator billing.
    The application developer can sell and deliver the following types of products to end users:
<table>
<tr><td> -Premium levels for games.</td></tr>
<tr><td> -Virtual goods, such as additional weapons for a game, or in-game currency.</td></tr>
<tr><td> -Downloadable components, such as city maps for a location-based guide application.</td></tr>
</table>
<P>     
    This API provides an abstract high level interface for application developers to integrate the in-app purchase 
    functionality into their Java applications that are published on the Nokia Store. 
    The key features provided by this API are:
</P>
<table>
<tr><td> -Requesting data for purchaseable products from the Nokia Store.</td></tr>
<tr><td> -Initiating the purchase flow.</td></tr>
<tr><td> -Restoring an earlier purchased Nokia Store item.</td></tr>
</table>

  The application developers may protect their content either by use of built-in Digital Rights Management (DRM), or apply their own access control.
