      <h1>Appendix B. Launching applications with MIDP 2.x PushRegistry</h1>
      <p>In order to minimize memory consumption in the device and to improve
         	usability of the RF applications, this specifications provides means for starting
         	applications based on events on RFID hardware. This means that when a target
         	of requested type or target containing the requested NDEF record appears in
         	the proximity of the device, applications registered for this event are started.
      </p>
      <p>There are several ways to provide this functionality. <code class="classname">PushRegistry</code>
         	defined in the MIDP 2.x specification is the most suitable way and it is well
         	known in the developer community. The nature of RFID based communication has
         	to be taken into account when using <code class="classname">PushRegistry</code>. Even
         	though application is started based on discovered contactless target, the target
         	may not be available anymore when the application tries to open a connection
         	to it. In this case, the <code class="classname">Connector.open</code> method throws
         	an <code class="classname">IOException</code>. Following chapters describe how the
         	application startup based on RFID events is done using MIDP 2.x
         	<code class="classname">PushRegistry</code>.
      </p>
      <h3><a id="d0e9671"></a>NFC Forum NDEF record push
      </h3>
      <p>This specification provides application startup based on targets that
         	have NFC Forum NDEF records. Registration for startup is based on the record
         	type name and format of the NDEF record. There can be one application for each
         	record type name and format pair registered for startup at a time. If data on
         	the target contains more than one NDEF record, the startup is based on the
         	record type name and format of the first matching record in the data.
      </p>
      <p>When a target is discovered, the application management software checks
         	the <code class="classname">PushRegistry</code> entries. If there is an entry for the
         	NDEF record type name and format in the target, the application having that
         	entry is started. If there is no <code class="classname">PushRegistry</code> entry,
         	notification about discovered NDEF record is sent to the registered application
         	that has set the <code class="classname">NDEFRecordListener</code> for that NDEF record
         	type.

         	the <code class="classname">externalTransactionDetected</code> notification. Notification
         	will also be sent to all other applications that have registered the

      <h3><a id="d0e9761"></a>Implementation notes
      </h3>
      <p>Unlike the push connections defined in JSR 118 for MIDP 2.x, the protocol
         	defined in this specification includes a mechanism where the notification about
         	discovered targets is held until it is processed by the started application.
      </p>
      <p>When the application is started in response to a Push message, the application
         	<strong style="text-transform: lowercase">should</strong> immediately register
         	<code class="classname">NDEFRecordListener</code> to receive notifications about
         	discovered NDEF record. This guarantees that the application will receive the
         	<code class="classname">ndefRecordDetected</code> notifications right away. If an
         	application fails to register the listeners when started, the platform
         	implementation may delete notifications that have been stored, if it becomes
         	necessary to do so.
