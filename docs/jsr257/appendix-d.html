    <h1>Appendix D. Future items</h1>
    <p>During the development of this specification version 1.0 some of the items
      originally planned to be included were left out from the specification. This
      specification provides Java API for the features defined by the NFC Forum.
      And as some of the specifications needed in this Java API were not finalized
      in the NFC Forum during the development of this specification, these features
      were left out to be included in the later version. These features to be later
      included into the JSR 257 specification include:
    </p>
    <div class="itemizedlist">
      <ul type="disc">
        <li>
          <p>NFC peer-to-peer communication</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Connection interfaces for the NFC Forum mandated tag types</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <p>NFC Forum peer-to-peer communication allows exchanging data between two
      NFC enabled devices. The protocol for this half-duplex communication is defined
      in the NFC Forum.
    </p>
    <p>The NFC Forum mandates the support for NDEF mapping to few physical tag
      types. In addition to this mapping, the NFC Forum also publishes a set of
      commands that can be used to access the manufacturer specific parts and data
      structures in the physical tags. The intent for this Java API is to provide
      standardized connection interfaces for these manufacturer specific parts.
      The finalization of the public command sets was ongoing when this version 1.0
      of this specification was finalized.
