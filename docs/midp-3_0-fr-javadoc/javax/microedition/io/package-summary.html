<P>
MID Profile includes networking support based on the
      <code>Generic Connection</code> framework from the
      <em>Connected, Limited Device Configuration</em>.

    <p>
        Unless otherwise noted, passing a null argument to a
        constructor or method in any class or interface in this package
        MUST cause a NullPointerException to be thrown.

<H2 class="section">HTTP Networking </H2>
    <p>
        In addition to the <code>javax.microedition.io</code>
        classes specified in the <em>Connected Limited Device
        Configuration</em> the <em>Mobile Information Device
        Profile</em> includes the following interface for the HTTP
        access.
    </p>
        <ul>
            <li><code>javax.microedition.io.HttpConnection</code></li>
        </ul>
    <p>
        An <code>HttpConnection</code> is returned from
        <code>Connector.open()</code> when an <code>"http://"</code> connection
        string is accessed.
    </p>
    <p>
        The MIDP extends the connectivity support
        provided by the Connected, Limited Device Configuration (CLDC) with
        specific functionality for the
        <EM>GenericConnection</EM>
        framework. The MIDP supports a subset of the HTTP protocol,
        which can be implemented using both IP protocols such as TCP/IP
        and non-IP protocols such as WAP and i-Mode, utilizing a gateway
        to provide access to HTTP servers on the Internet. The IP protocol in this
        chapter covers both IPv4 and IPv6 addressing.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <EM>GenericConnection</EM>
        framework is used to support client-server and datagram
        networks. Using only the protocols specified by the MIDP will allow
        the application to be portable to all MIDs. MIDP implementations
        MUST provide support for accessing HTTP 1.1 servers and
        services.
    </p>
    <p>
        There are wide variations in wireless
        networks. It is the joint responsibility of the device and the
        wireless network to provide the application service. It may require
        a <EM>gateway</EM>
        that can bridge between the wireless transports specific to the
        network and the wired Internet. The client application and the
        Internet server MUST NOT need to be required to know either that
        non-IP networks are being used or the characteristics of those
        networks. While the client and server MAY both take advantage of
        such knowledge to optimize their transmissions, they MUST NOT be
        required to do so.
    </p>
    <p>
        For example, a MID MAY have no in-device
        support for the Internet Protocol (IP). In this case, it would
        utilize a gateway  to access the
        Internet, and the gateway would be responsible for some services,
        such as DNS name resolution for Internet URLs. The device and
        network may define and implement security and network access
        policies that restrict access.

      The <EM>GenericConnection</EM>
      framework from the CLDC provides the base stream and content
      interfaces. The interface
      <EM>HttpConnection</EM>
      provides the additional functionality needed to set request
      headers, parse response headers, and perform other HTTP specific
      functions. </p>

    <p>The interface MUST support:</p>
    <BLOCKQUOTE>
      HTTP 1.1
    </BLOCKQUOTE>
    <p>
          Each device implementing the MIDP
          MUST support opening connections using the following URL
          schemes (<a href="overview.html#RFC3986">[RFC3986]</a> ,
          <em>Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI): Generic
          Syntax</em>) :
    </p>

    <BLOCKQUOTE>
      &quot;http&quot; as defined by
      <a href="overview.html#RFC2616">[RFC2616]</a>
      <EM>Hypertext Transfer Protocol --
        HTTP/1.1</EM>
    </BLOCKQUOTE>
    <p>
        Each device implementing the MIDP
        MUST support the full specification of <a href="overview.html#RFC2616">[RFC2616]</a><BR>
        HEAD, GET, POST, PUT and DELETE requests. The implementation MUST also
        support the absolute forms of URIs. Support for PUT and DELETE requests
        was added to version 3.0 of the MIDP specification.
    </p>
    <p>
        The implementation MUST pass all
        request headers supplied by the application and response headers
        as supplied by the network server. The ordering of request and
        response headers MAY be changed. While the headers may be
        transformed in transit, they MUST be reconstructed as equivalent
        headers on the device and server. Any transformations MUST be
        transparent to the application and origin server. The HTTP
        implementation does not automatically include any headers for applications
        in other than Unidentified Third Party Protection Domains. The application
        itself is responsible for setting any request headers that it needs.
        For the MIDlets in the Unidentified Third Party Protection Domain, the
          <code>HttpConnection</code> and <code>HttpsConnection</code> MUST include
        in the User-Agent header the Product-Token "UNTRUSTED/1.0". User-Agent
        headers supplied by the application MUST NOT be deleted. This behavior
        for the Unidentified domain applications is specified in the Mobile Service
        Architecture (JSR 248) specification.
    </p>
    <p>
        Connections may be implemented with
        any suitable protocol providing the ability to reliably
        transport the HTTP headers and data.(<a href="overview.html#RFC2616">[RFC2616]</a>
        takes great care to not to mandate TCP streams as the only required
        transport mechanism.)
    </p>

<h3 class="section">HTTP Request Headers</h3>
    <p>
        The HTTP 1.1 specification provides a
        rich set of request and response headers that allow the
        application to negotiate the form, format, language, and other
        attributes of the content retrieved. In the MIDP, the
        application is responsible for selection and processing of
        request and response headers. Only the
        <EM>User-Agent</EM>
        header is described in detail. Any other header that is mutually
        agreed upon with the server may be used.
    </p>

<h3 class="section">User-Agent and Accept-Language Request Headers</h3>
    <p>
        For the MIDP, a simple
        <EM >User-Agent</EM>
        field may be used to identify the current device. As specified
        by <a href="overview.html#RFC2616">[RFC2616]</a>,
        the field contains blank separated features where
        the feature contains a name and optional version number.
    </p>
    <p>
        The application is responsible for
        formatting and requesting that the
        <EM>User-Agent</EM>
        field be included in HTTP requests via the
        <EM>setRequestProperty</EM>
        method in the interface
        <EM>javax.microedition.io.HttpConnection</EM>.
        It can supply any application-specific features that are
        appropriate, in addition to any of the profile-specific
        request header values listed below.
    </p>
    <p>
        Applications are not required
        to be loaded onto the device using HTTP. But if they are, then the
        <EM>User-Agent</EM>
        request header SHOULD be included in requests to load an
        application descriptor or application JAR onto the
        device. This will allow the server to provide the most
        appropriate application for the device.
    </p>
    <p>
        The user-agent and accept-language fields SHOULD contain
        the following features as defined by system properties using
        <EM> java.lang.System.getProperty</EM>.
        If multiple values are present they will need to be reformatted
        into individual fields in the request header.

<H2 class="section">StreamConnection Behavior</H2>
    <p>
        All MIDP <code>StreamConnections</code> have one underlying
        <code>InputStream</code> and one <code>OutputStream</code>.

        Opening a <code>DataInputStream</code> counts as opening an
        <code>InputStream</code> and opening a
        <code>DataOutputStream</code> counts as opening an
        <code>OutputStream</code>.

        Trying to open another <code>InputStream</code> or another
        <code>OutputStream</code> from a <code>StreamConnections</code>
        causes an <code>IOException</code>.

        Trying to open  <code>InputStream</code> or
        <code>OutputStream</code> after they have been closed
        causes an <code>IOException</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
        After calling the <code>close</code> method, regardless of open
        streams, further method calls to connection will result in
        <code>IOExceptions</code> for those methods that are declared to
        throw <code>IOExceptions</code>.
        For the methods that do not throw exceptions, unknown
        results may be returned.
    </p>

    <p>
        The methods of <code>StreamConnections</code> are not
        synchronized.

        The only stream method that can be called safely in another
        thread is <code>close</code>.

        When <code>close</code> is invoked on a stream that is executing
        in another thread, any pending  I/O method MUST throw an
        <code>InterruptedIOException</code>.

        In the above case implementations SHOULD try to throw the
        exception in a timely manner.

        When all open streams have been closed, and when the
        <code>StreamConnections</code> is closed, any pending I/O
        operations MUST be interrupted in a timely manner.
    </p>

<H2 class="section">Secure Networking</H2>
    <p>
        Since the MIDP 2.0 release additional interfaces are
        available for secure communication with WWW network
        services. Secure interfaces are provided by
        HTTPS and SSL/TLS protocol access over the IP network.
        Refer to the package documentation of
        <code>javax.microedition.pki</code> for the details of
        certificate profile that applies to secure connections.
        An <code>HttpsConnection</code> is returned from
        <code>Connector.open()</code> when an <code>"https://"</code> connection
        string is accessed.
        A <code>SecureConnection</code> is returned from
        <code>Connector.open()</code> when an <code>"ssl://"</code> connection
        string is accessed.

<H2 class="section">Low Level IP Networking</H2>
    <p>
        Since the MIDP 2.0 release, the MIDP specification also
        includes optional networking support for TCP/IP
        sockets and UDP/IP datagrams. For each of the following schemes,
        a host is specified for an outbound connection and the host is omitted
        for an inbound connection.

        The host can be a host name, a literal IPv4 address or a literal
        IPv6 address (according to <a href="overview.html#RFC2732">[RFC2732]</a>,
        square bracket characters '[' ']' MUST be used to designate an IPv6 address
        in URL strings). Implementations MUST be able to parse the URL string and
        recognize the address format used, but are not required to
        support all address formats and associated protocols.
    </p>
    <p>
        When the host and port number are both omitted from the <code>socket</code>
        or <code>datagram</code> connection, the system will allocate
        an available port. The host and port numbers allocated in this
        fashion can
        be discovered using the <code> getLocalAddress</code> and
        <code>getLocalPort</code> methods. The colon (:) may be omitted when
        the connection string does not include the port parameter.
    </p>
    <p>
        A <code>SocketConnection</code> is returned from
        <code>Connector.open()</code> when a <code>"socket://host:port"</code>
        connection string is accessed.
        A <code>ServerSocketConnection</code> is returned from
        <code>Connector.open()</code> when a <code>"socket://:port"</code>
        connection string is accessed.
        A <code>UDPDatagramConnection</code> is returned from
        <code>Connector.open()</code> when a <code>"datagram://host:port"</code>
        connection string is accessed.

<H2 class="section">Push Applications</H2>
    <p>
        A <code>PushRegistry</code> is available
        which provides a MIDlet with a means of registering for network
        connection events, which may be delivered when the application
        is not currently running.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>javax.microedition.io.PushRegistry</code></li>
    </ul>

<H2 class="section">Serial Port Communications</H2>
    <p>
        A <code>CommConnection</code> is available
        which provides a MIDlet with a means of registering for network
        accessing a local serial port as a stream connection.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>javax.microedition.io.CommConnection</code></li>
    </ul>

<H2 class="section">IP Version Support</H2>
    <p>
        When a MIDlet executes on a device that has support for the Internet
        Protocol (IP), it MAY specify which version of IP to use, version 4,
        version 6 or either version. The specification of IP version MUST be done
                at installation time in the manifest and JAD. The attribute
                <code>MIDlet-Required-IP-Version = value (ipv4|ipv6|any)</code>
        specifies the IP version all MIDlets in a suite MUST use, or whether both
        are allowed. If the attribute is not given in the manifest, it means that
                the MIDlet is able to handle any type of IP addresses. If the implementation
                can not support the requested version, the MIDlet suite MUST fail to install
                and return <a href="provisioning.html#StatusCodes"><code>Status Code 905
                (Attribute Mismatch)</code></a> to report the problem.
        </p>

        <p>
                The attribute <code>MIDlet-Required-IP-Version</code> also has a runtime
                meaning. It means that the implementation MUST use the specified IP version
                in all the network connections used by the MIDlet. The implementation
                MUST NOT allow a MIDlet to make connections to ports that have been dedicated
                to different IP version usage than what the MIDlet is requiring. If the
                implementation cannot provide the MIDlet with the required IP version at
                runtime, an <code>IOException</code> MUST be thrown.
    </p>

<h2 class="section">Inter-MIDlet Communications (IMC)</h2>
    <p>
        The MIDP Inter-MIDlet Communication protocol defines a low-level, asynchronous,
        bi-directional stream connection to support direct communication links between
        MIDlets. Very similar to the socket protocol, the IMC protocol provides for
        both client and server connection. When an IMC client makes a connection to
        a server, the IMC server is identified by MIDlet UID, and the IMC server name and
        version. The MIDlet UID is the unique identifier of a MIDlet suite, composed
        of the combination of the MIDlet's name, vendor, and version. The MIDlet UID is omitted
        in the connection URL strings when opening an IMC server connection. More information
        about the MIDlet UIDs can be found in Chapter 16.
    </p>

    <p>
        The Inter-MIDlet Communication protocol MUST be supported by all implementations.
    </p>

    <p>
        LIBlets enable MIDlet suites to share software components; however, a MIDlet suite
        and the LIBlets it depends upon are statically bound at installation into a single
        isolated runtime execution environment. Further, code belonging to a single LIBlet
        and bound to multiple MIDlet suites' execution environments cannot easily
        exchange data at runtime.
    </p>

    <p>
        With the introduction of Inter-MIDlet communication, a MIDlet will be able to access
        a shareable component running inside another execution environment through thin
        client APIs, and thus make possible component-based programming for MIDP applications.
        The shareable component runs inside another MIDlet execution environment and handles
        requests from other MIDlets.
    </p>

    <p>
        An example use case for Inter-MIDlet communication is a media decoder. In this use case,
        a media player MIDlet invokes a GUI-less decoder MIDlet through an IMC connection to
        decode a media stream with a content type not supported by the device. These decoder
        MIDlets are executed as if they were LIBlets bound to the player MIDlet, but can
        be individually installed or deleted and run inside isolated execution environments.
    </p>

    <p>
        The following interfaces are defined for Inter-MIDlet communication:
    </p>
        <ul>
            <li><code>javax.microedition.io.IMCConnection</code></li>
            <li><code>javax.microedition.io.IMCServerConnection</code></li>
        </ul>

    <p>
        An IMC server has the ability to restrict the set of clients that are allowed
        to connect to it. This is achieved by specifying the need for access authorization
        when a server connection is created. Only clients that match a server MIDlet's
        access authorization requirements are allowed to connect to the server; see
        <a href="security_framework.html#AppLevelAccessAuth"> Application Level
        Access Authorization</a> for more details.
    </p>

    <p>
        A MIDlet starting an IMC server can be launched in the background when the device
        is powered on, or at client request.  Unlike LIBlet code static sharing, a MIDlets
        IMC server can be independently shut down and unloaded from memory if it is no
        longer serving client requests. An IMC server can either display screens to the
        user to gather inputs upon receiving a request from a client, or do the processing
        in the background silently without any GUI, as if it were part of the original
        MIDlet's execution to the user's experience.
    </p>

<H2 class="section">Security of Networking Functions</H2>
    <p>
        The MIDP security model provides a framework that allows APIs and functions to be
        restricted to MIDlet suites that have been granted permissions either by signing or
        explicitly by the user. See <a href="security_framework.html#security_framework">
        Security for MIDP Applications</a> for details about granting specific permissions to a
        <code>MIDlet</code> suite.
    </p>

    <p>
        The risks associated with a MIDlet suite's use of the network are related to the
        potential for network abuse and to costs to the device owner since network
        usage may result in charges. MIDP provides a security framework in which network
        functions can be protected and allowed only to those applications that have requested
        and been granted appropriate permissions.
    </p>

    <p>
        Connections made using the Generic Connection Framework Connector.open to local
        addresses on the device do not cause chargeable events and as such SHOULD NOT result
        in a prompt to the user.  This includes access to hostname "localhost", the IP address
        127.0.0.1, and other local IP addresses.
    </p>

    <p>
        Each protocol is accessed by invoking <code>javax.microedition.io.Connector.open</code>
        with a URI including the protocol and arguments. CLDC 1.1.1 defines the permissions that
        protect access to protocols accessed via <code>Connector.open</code>.
        Devices are NOT REQUIRED to implement every protocol.
    </p>

<A NAME="push"/>
<H2 class="section">Security of PushRegistry</H2>
        <p>
            The <code>PushRegistry</code> is protected using the security
            framework and permissions. The MIDlet suite must have the
            <code>javax.microedition.io.PushRegistryPermission</code> to
            register an alarm based launch, to register dynamically using
            the <code>PushRegistry</code> and to make a static registration
            in the application descriptor. <code>PushRegistryPermission</code> also
            determines if the user needs to be prompted prior to invoking a MIDlet
            in response to a Push connection event or an alarm. When user is
            prompted on the event of an alarm or push registration, the
            implementation SHOULD allow for user to select whether to be prompted
            or not for application auto-launch.
        </p>

        <p>
            The interaction modes control when the user is prompted to access the
            protected <code>PushRegistry</code> functionality. Depending on the
            policy, they user MAY be prompted only once or each time restricted
            function is called, including the automatic launch of the
            application. If the user is prompted at installation time to allow
            static push registration and the user does not accept the prompt,
            the installation of the MIDlet suite SHOULD fail with status code 910.
        </p>

    <p>
        The push mechanism uses protocols in which the device is
        acting as the server and connections can be accepted from other
        elements of the network. To use the push mechanisms the MIDlet
        suite will need the permission to use the server connection.

        For example, to register a chat program that can be started via
        push might use the following attributes in the manifest:
    </p>

     <PRE>
MIDlet-Push-1: socket://:79, com.sun.example.SampleChat, *
MIDlet-Permission-1: javax.microedition.io.PushRegistryPermission "socket:" "static,dynamic"
MIDlet-Permission-2: javax.microedition.io.SocketProtocolPermission "socket://"
