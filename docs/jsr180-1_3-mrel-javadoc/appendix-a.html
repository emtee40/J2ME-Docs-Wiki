         			This section provides implementation notes for platform
         			developers deploying the JSR 180 interfaces on a MIDP 2.0
         			platform. This section addresses features available in a
         			MIDP 2.0 device that can be used to enhance SIP
         			applications.

      <p>
         			To send and receive messages (requests/responses) using this
         			API, applications MUST be granted a permission to perform
         			the requested operation. The mechanisms for granting a
         			permission are implementation dependent.

            				The MIDP 2.0 specification defines a mechanism for
            				granting permissions to use privileged features. This
            				mechanism is based on a policy mechanism enforced in the
            				platform implementation. The following permissions are
            				defined for the JSR 180 functionality, when deployed
            				with a JSR 118 MIDP 2.0 implementation.
            			
         </p>
         <p>
            				To open a connection, a MIDlet suite requires an
            				appropriate permission to access the SIPConnection
            				implementation. If the permission is not granted, then
            				Connector.open methods MUST throw a
            				<code class="classname">SecurityException</code>
            				. The following table indicates the permission that must
            				be granted for each protocol.

        JSR180 Push Capabilities and SIP Identity Sharing in MIDP 2.0
      </h3>
      <p>
        MIDP 2.0 defines a mechanism to register a MIDlet when a
        connection notification event is detected. Once the MIDlet
        has been launched it performs the same I/O operations it
        would normally use to open a connection and read and write
        data. For JSR 180 applications this capability allows the
        application to be launched if a message arrives either while
        the MIDlet is not running or while another MIDlet is
        running.
      </p>
      <div class="sect2" lang="en">

                  </h3>

         </div>
         <p>
           Push registrations are either defined in the application
           descriptor or made dynamically at runtime via
           PushRegistry. The entry for a SIP protocol will include
           the connection URI string which identifies the scheme
           and port number of the inbound message connection. The
           entry also contains a filter field that designates which
           senders are permitted to send messages that launch the
           registered MIDlet. An asterisk ("*") and question mark
           ("?") can be used in the filter field as wild cards as
           specified in the MIDP 2.0 specification.
         </p>
         <p>
           For the SIP protocol, the filter field is matched
           against the URI of the From field in the received
           message.
         </p>
         <p>
           The URI may also have a media feature tag (MIME type of
           the application) that associates the MIDlet with the
           SipConnectionNotifier. See definitions here: "Opening
           new server connection" and "Routing the incoming
           request". This media feature tag is compared with the
           tag included in the received request. This funcionality
           is based on the SIP Working Group specifications RFC3840
           [4] and RFC3841 [5].
         </p>
         <p>
           The URI may also include a trasport paramater
	   (<code>;transport={transport}</code>) as defined in
	   the specification for interface SipConnection.
	   When the parameter is omitted, UDP is used as the default for
	   SIP connections as defined in RFC 3261.
         </p>
         <p>
           As a summary SIP PushRegistry may have following kind of
           entries:

           Furthermore, the MIDlet can register dynamically to the
           Push Registry when opening the connection by passing the
           same augmented SIP URI to the Connector. Example:
         </p><pre class="programlisting">
	   String midletName = "com.company.sip.SIPExample2";
	   String serverURI = "sip:5080"; SipConnectionNotifier scn = (SipConnectionNotifier) Connector.open(sURI);
	   PushRegistry.registerConnection(serverURI, midletName, "*");
	 </pre><p>
           Following table defines how the system is routing
           messages to MIDlets when registered in PushRegistry. It
           should be noticed that the system requires either port
           number or at least MIME type for the routing decision.

            				Unlike the initial push connections defined in MIDP 2.0,
            				the SIP protocol includes an explicit buffering
            				mechanism where messages are held until processed by
            				some application that reads and deletes messages. If a
            				message is delivered to the device and does not pass the
            				specified filter, the message will be deleted by the
            				Application Management Software.
            			
         </p>
         <p>
            				When the application is started in response to a Push
            				request, the application SHOULD read and process all
            				messages that are buffered for it. If an application
            				fails to read and process the messages when started or
            				if starting of the application is denied (for example,
            				by the end user), the platform implementation MAY delete
            				unread messages from the buffer, if it becomes necessary
            				to do so. For example, the platform implementation may
            				delete messages when the buffer becomes full.
            			
         </p>
         <p>
            				Another difference between the JSR180 interface and
            				other protocol handlers in MIDP 2.0, is that JSR180
            				includes a SipConnectionNotifier which provides
            				asynchronous callbacks when messages become available
            				while the application is running.

      <h3>
         			Portable JSR180 applications between MIDP1.0 and MIDP2.0
         		
      </h3>
      <p>
         			If permitted by the device security policy, a JSR180
         			application written for a MIDP 1.0 platform will work
         			without any modification on a MIDP 2.0 system. This behavior
         			is defined by the MIDP 2.0 specification of untrusted
         			applications. MIDP 2.0 also supports the concept of trusted
         			applications. For these applications, the device can
         			automatically handle trust decisions based on signed JAR
         			files and a platform-specific policy mechanism that
         			associates specific permissions with the signed application.
         		
      </p>
      <p>
         			The security model also allows for the definition of
         			user-granted permissions on a one-shot, session or blanket
         			authorization. In many cases, the platform-dependent policy
         			for permissions on MIDP 1.0 will be able to be mapped onto
         			the MIDP 2.0 defined permissions. An application designed to
         			work only on a MIDP 2.0 device can use the methods in the
         			PushRegistry class to check if there are active connections
         			(listConnections) or to add or remove registered connections
         			at runtime (registerConnection or unregisterConnection).
         		
      </p>
      <p>
         			An application designed to run portably on MIDP 1.0 or MIDP
         			2.0 platforms will only use the application descriptor and
         			attributes in the manifest to describe requested permissions
         			and push registration entries. See the MIDP 2.0
         			specification for details about the MIDlet-Permissions and
         			MIDlet-Push-&lt;n&gt; attributes. On a MIDP 1.0 platforms
         			these properties will be ignored. On a MIDP 2.0 platform,
         			these properties will direct the application management
         			software to perform the necessary checks and registrations
         			when the application is installed and removed from the
         			system.
