         <p> If the 
            <span class="emphasis"><em>Mobile Sensor API</em></span>
            
            is implemented on top of the MIDP 2.0, the 
            <code class="literal">PushRegistry</code>
            is used for registering applications
            for automatic launch. The 
            <code class="literal">PushRegistry</code>
            
            maintains a list of registrations. When the application is
            registered, the sensor URL containing the conditions for launch is
            specified together with the application to be launched. The
            application management software (AMS) monitors the defined sensors.
            When the sensor becomes available or one of the monitored
            conditions is met, the AMS finds the application to be woken up and
            launches it.
         </p>
         
         <p>The AMS MUST store the data value that caused the automatic
            launch of the application when the monitored condition was met, as
            well as the met condition. The validity, uncertainty and timestamp
            information MUST also be stored. When availability is monitored,
            there is no special requirement to store any values.
         </p>
         
         <p>The automatic launch by push mechanism may not always mean that
            the application is immediately started. The user may get a prompt
            indicating that the application should be launched and the actual
            launch will happen only once the user confirms to accept it.
            Whether the user gets a prompt or not depends on the security
            policy for push. Therefore, the delay between the match in the
            monitoring and the actual launch of the application may be
            considerably long. The data values in between the met condition and
            the first data retrieval method call MUST be discarded. The AMS
            MUST supply the data value that caused the application launch as a 
            <code class="literal">ConditionListener.conditionMet()</code>
            
            notification to the application when the application opens the 
            <code class="literal">SensorConnection</code>
            and registers itself as
            the 
            <code class="literal">ConditionListener</code>
            to monitor the
            data. The registration is done in the special manner, for
            example:
         </p>
         <pre class="screen">
    channel.addCondition(this, null);
</pre>
         <p>This will cause the pending 
            <code class="literal">conditionMet()</code>
            notification to be sent to the 
            <code class="literal">ConditionListener</code>
            whatever is the channel or
            the condition met. Note that the 
            <code class="literal">conditionMet()</code>
            notification will be sent only once
            when the 
            <code class="literal">addCondition()</code>
            method with the 
            <code class="literal">null</code>
            condition value is called for the
            first time. After the connection to the sensor is closed, the
            information is deleted.

            Sensor URL scheme for push
         </h3>
         
         
         <p>The sensor URL scheme for the 
            <code class="literal">PushRegistry</code>
            defined in the description of the 
            <code class="literal">SensorConnection</code>
            class reflects the
            two ways of sensor push:
         </p>
         
         <p>
            
         </p>
         <div class="orderedlist">
            <ol type="1">
               <li>
                  
                  <p> Availability-based push. When, for example, the wired sensor is
                     plugged in or the sensor working over Bluetooth is coming within
                     the proximity of the device, the application is launched. No
                     conditions are defined.
                  </p>
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  
                  <p> Condition-based push. There are conditions defined in the query
                     part of the URL. The conditions are defined separately for each
                     channel. The query part means the part starting from the question
                     mark ("?"). In addition to the availability at least one of the set
                     conditions has to be met for the application to be launched.
                  </p>

            Availability-based push
         </h3>
         
         
         <p>"Being available" means that the sensor can be opened and data
            values read. By using push mechanism, the sensor application can be
            launched automatically when the sensor becomes available. Some
            sensors may not support availability-based push. For example, if
            you have an embedded sensor that is always available,
            availability-based push is not supported. Whether the sensor
            supports availability-based push can be found out with the method 
            <code class="literal">SensorInfo.isAvailabilityPushSupported()</code>
            .
         </p>
         
         <p>An example of availability-based push is presented below. The
            MIDlet is registered statically in the JAD:
         </p>
         <pre class="screen">
    MIDlet-Push-1: sensor:humidity,sample.PushApp,*
    MIDlet-Permissions: javax.microedition.io.PushRegistry
       
</pre>
         <p>The AMS system checks periodically the availability of supported
            humiditymeters around. When any of these humiditymeters becomes
            available, the PushApp MIDlet is launched.
         </p>
         
         
         <h3 xmlns="" xmlns:db="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude">
            
            Condition-based push
         </h3>
         
         
         <p>"Meeting conditions" means that measured value meets one of the
            set conditions. The conditions are set per channel. After one
            condition of any channel is met, the registered application is
            launched. The sensor URL scheme for the 
            <code class="literal">PushRegistry</code>
            does not define conditions for
            channels of an 
            <code class="literal">Object</code>
            data type.
            Whether a sensor supports condition-based push can be found out
            with the method 
            <code class="literal">SensorInfo.isConditionPushSupported()</code>
            .
         </p>
         
         <p>An example of condition-based push is presented below. The
            MIDlet is registered statically in the JAD:
         </p>
         <pre class="screen">
    MIDlet-Push-1: sensor:RR_interval?channel=RR_interval&amp;limit=240&amp;op=le,
                   sample.PushApp,*
    MIDlet-Permissions: javax.microedition.io.PushRegistry,
		   javax.microedition.sensor.PrivateSensor
       
</pre>
         <p>The AMS system checks periodically the availability of supported
            <code class="literal">RR_interval</code> sensors around.
            If a <code class="literal">RR_interval</code> sensor is available, then the
            defined conditions are checked. If any of the conditions is met,
            the application is launched. In the example above, the measured
            value being less than or equal to 240 ms causes the application to
            be launched.
         </p>

         <p>Note that there is also a possibility to register a well formed
            sensor URL, which is returning a zero-length 
            <code class="literal">SensorInfo</code>
            array when it is given as a parameter
            to the method 
            <code class="literal">SensorManager.findSensors(URL)</code>
            . The registration
            is possible if this type of a sensor is known to be supported in
            the future.
         </p>
         
         <p>If there are several sensors matching to the URL a

         <p>
            The same URL can be registed many times to launch different applications.
            The implementation may be able to provide data to many
            applications simultanously and this possibility should not be ruled out
            by accepting the URL only once. This enhances JSR 118 which says:<code class="literal">
               "If two MIDlet suites have a static push connection in common,
               they cannot be installed together and both function correctly.
               The end user would typically have to uninstall one before being
               able to successfully install the other."</code>

         <p>Some devices are only able to support one application being
            executed at a time. In such devices, if a sensor supports
            availability-based push, only one URL without conditions can be
            registered for that sensor. After such URL is registered, attempts
            to register more URLs MUST cause the registration to fail and an 
            <code class="literal">IOException</code>
            to be thrown.
         </p>
         
         <p>If a sensor supports condition-based push, it is possible to
            register multiple URLs containing conditions. In this case the
            conditions MUST not overlap. If conditions overlap, the
            registration MUST fail. There MAY be an implementation-dependent
            maximum for registrations of URLs with conditions. If
            availability-based and condition-based pushes are both supported,
            it's not possible to register URLs without conditions after one URL
            with conditions is registered.
         </p>
         
         <p>However, if there are several matching sensors, an 
            <code class="literal">IOException</code>
            is thrown only if none of the sensors
            can accept the URL.

         <p>Some devices are able to support multiple concurrently executing
            applications. In such devices, an arbitrary number of applications
            can be registered per sensor. The implementation SHOULD define a
            maximum for simultaneous registrations. An 
            <code class="literal">IOException</code>
            is thrown at push registration when
            the maximum number of registrations has been already reached for
            all the sensors matching the given URL.
         </p>
         
         <p>If multiple registrations per sensor are allowed, all the
            corresponding applications MUST be launched, either when the sensor
            becomes available or any of the conditions is met. Until the limit
            of applications to be executed simultaneously is reached, the
            implementation MAY decide freely the order in which applications
            are launched.
